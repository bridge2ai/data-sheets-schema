title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: >
  The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes
  Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The composition of the dataset was
  designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind, including recruitment sampling
  procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes
  severity, and a data acquisition protocol across multiple domains (survey data, physical measurements,
  clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that
  may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data.
  The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. Some
  data that are not considered sensitive personal health data will be available to the public for
  download upon agreement with a license. The full dataset will be accessible by entering into a data
  use agreement.

# MOTIVATION
# ============================================================================

purposes:
  - response: >
      Better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      using a harmonized, multi-site, multi-domain dataset designed for AI/ML research.

tasks:
  - response: >
      Enable downstream AI/ML analyses across survey, clinical, imaging, wearable device, and
      environmental data domains related to Type 2 Diabetes that may not be feasible with existing
      data sources such as claims or electronic health records alone.

addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Provide a harmonized, multi-site, multi-domain dataset enabling AI/ML analyses not feasible
      with existing single-source data, with recruitment targeting approximately equal distribution
      across diabetes severity levels.

instances:
  - representation: Individuals (participants) with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
    instance_type: Participants and their multi-domain measurements
    data_type: >
      Survey data, physical measurements, clinical data (monofilament and cognitive function testing),
      blood and urine lab results, imaging data (retinal images, ECG), wearable device data (fitness
      activity levels, blood sugar levels), and environmental data (home air quality).

subsets:
  - name: Public dataset
    description: >
      Data not considered sensitive personal health data, available for download upon agreement with
      a license. Includes survey data, blood and urine lab results, fitness activity levels, clinical
      measurements (monofilament and cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar
      levels, and environmental variables such as home air quality.
  - name: Controlled-access dataset
    description: >
      Full dataset accessible by entering into a data use agreement. Includes 5-digit zip code, sex,
      race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past health records, medications, and traffic and
      accident reports.

sampling_strategies:
  - is_sample:
      - >
        Yes. Participants recruited across 3 data collection sites.
  - is_random:
      - >
        No. Recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of
        participants across diabetes severity.
  - is_representative:
      - >
        Designed for approximate balance by diabetes severity; enrollment is ongoing, so pilot data
        release and periodic updates may not have achieved balanced distribution across groups.
  - strategies:
      - >
        Recruitment sampling to achieve approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity.

subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - With and without T2DM
      - Diabetes severity strata
    distribution:
      - >
        Recruitment aimed at approximately equal distribution by diabetes severity. Pilot and periodic
        releases may not achieve full balance due to ongoing enrollment.
