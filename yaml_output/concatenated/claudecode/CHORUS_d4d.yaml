title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  The CHoRUS (Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards) dataset is a
  multi-center, multi-modal, high-resolution collection of AI-ready clinical data designed to improve
  recovery from acute illness. As of November 2024, the dataset covers 14 different hospitals with
  23,400 unique admissions. Data are harmonized using unified standards including OMOP CDM for structured
  EHR data, WFDB for waveform telemetry, DICOM for imaging, OHNLP for clinical notes, and EDF+ for EEG.
  The dataset provides comprehensive electronic health record data, medication administration with
  time-stamped dosing, procedures, high-frequency nursing flowsheets, diagnoses, tokenized clinical notes,
  medical imaging from PACS, bedside monitor waveform telemetry, and hospital EEG. Data are retrospectively
  collected and made available under controlled access with licensing agreements. The CHoRUS Network spans
  20 academic centers (14 Data Acquisition centers) and emphasizes ethical sourcing, patient-focused
  approaches to privacy and bias, Social Determinants of Health, and federated access enabling balanced
  and diverse cohort sampling.
