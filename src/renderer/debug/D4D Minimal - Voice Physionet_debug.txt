Row 4: description | The human voice contains complex acoustic markers which have been linked to important health conditions including dementia, mood disorders, and cancer. The Bridge2AI-Voice project seeks to create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to enable future research in AI and provide insights into using voice as a biomarker of health. This release provides derived voice features (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs) alongside extensive clinical phenotype data, all collected under a standardized protocol across multiple sites. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
