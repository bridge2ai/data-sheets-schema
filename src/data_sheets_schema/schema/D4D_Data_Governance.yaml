      NOTE: This enum classifies data sensitivity and access control (WHO can access),
      which is orthogonal to DataUsePermissionEnum that specifies use restrictions
      (WHAT authorized users can do with data). ConfidentialityLevelEnum determines
      access requirements, while DataUsePermissionEnum uses DUO terms to specify
      permitted uses once access is granted.
