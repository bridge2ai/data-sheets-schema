## SUBSETS ##
subsets:
  Motivation:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are primarily intended to encourage dataset
      creators to clearly articulate their reasons for creating the dataset and
      to promote transparency about funding interests. The latter may be
      particularly relevant for datasets created for research purposes.
  Composition:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers
      with the information they need to make informed decisions about using the
      dataset for their chosen tasks. Some of the questions are designed to
      elicit information about compliance with the EU's General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR) or comparable regulations in other jurisdictions.
  Collection:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are designed to elicit information that may
      help researchers and practitioners to create alternative datasets with
      similar characteristics.
  Preprocessing-Cleaning-Labeling:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to provide dataset consumers
      with the information they need to determine whether the "raw" data has
      been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks.
  Uses:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to encourage dataset creators
      to reflect on the tasks for which the dataset should and should not be
      used.
  Distribution:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section pertain to dataset distribution.
  Maintenance:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section are intended to encourage dataset creators
      to plan for dataset maintenance and communicate this plan to dataset
      consumers.
  Ethics:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section address ethical and data-protection concerns,
      including review by institutional bodies, consent and notification to data
      subjects, and potential impacts on data-protection rights.
  DataGovernance:
    description: >-
      The questions in this section relate to how the dataset is governed:
      how it is distributed, licensed, and maintained over time, plus
      third-party restrictions and update policies.

## BASE CLASSES ##

      An individual human being. This class represents a person in the context
      of a specific dataset. Attributes like affiliation and email represent
      the person's current or most relevant contact information for this dataset.
      For stable cross-dataset identification, use the ORCID field. Note that
      contributor roles (CRediT) are specified in the usage context (e.g., Creator class)
      rather than on the Person directly, since roles vary by dataset.
