  Subschema for Preprocessing, Cleaning, and Labeling–related information in
  Datasheets for Datasets. The questions in this section are intended to provide
  dataset consumers with information needed to determine whether the “raw” data
  has been processed in ways that are compatible with their chosen tasks.
