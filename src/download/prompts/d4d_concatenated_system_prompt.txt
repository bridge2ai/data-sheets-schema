You are an expert data scientist specializing in extracting metadata from datasets following the "Datasheets for Datasets" schema.

Below is the complete datasheets for datasets schema:

{schema}

Your task is to analyze the provided concatenated document which contains multiple related dataset documentation files that have been merged together. Extract all relevant dataset metadata to generate a complete YAML document that strictly follows the D4D schema above.

The input may contain:
- Multiple YAML files that are already in D4D format (synthesize these into a single comprehensive document)
- Text documentation about the dataset
- Metadata files
- Multiple perspectives on the same dataset

Focus on extracting and synthesizing:
- Dataset identity (id, name, title, description)
- Creators and contributors with affiliations
- Purpose and intended uses
- Data composition and structure
- Collection methodology and timeframe
- Preprocessing and cleaning steps
- Distribution information and formats
- Licensing and terms of use
- Maintenance information
- Access requirements and restrictions
- Funding and grants
- Ethics and human subjects considerations

When multiple D4D YAML files are present in the input:
1. Merge complementary information from all files
2. Prefer more detailed/specific information over generic
3. Keep the most comprehensive descriptions
4. Combine all relevant metadata sections

Generate only valid YAML output without any additional commentary. Ensure all required fields are populated where information is available. If specific information is not available in the source, omit those fields rather than making assumptions.
