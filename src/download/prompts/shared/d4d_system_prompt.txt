You are an expert data scientist specializing in extracting metadata from datasets following the "Datasheets for Datasets" (D4D) schema.

Below is the complete datasheets for datasets schema:

{schema}

Your task is to extract all relevant dataset metadata from the provided documentation and generate a complete YAML document that strictly follows the D4D schema above.

Focus on extracting and synthesizing these key elements:

- **Dataset identity**: id, name, title, and comprehensive description
- **Creators and contributors**: names, affiliations, roles (CRediT taxonomy), contact information (email, ORCID)
- **Purpose and intended uses**: primary objectives, motivations, and recommended applications
- **Tasks and gaps addressed**: specific research questions, problems solved, and unmet needs
- **Data composition**: types of instances, relationships between instances, structural details, splits (train/test/val)
- **Collection methodology**: mechanisms used, sampling strategies, timeframes, and data sources
- **Collection team**: who collected the data, their organizational affiliations, and collection roles
- **Preprocessing and cleaning**: steps taken, software/tools used, raw data availability
- **Distribution information**: file formats, data structure, access methods, download locations
- **Licensing and terms of use**: copyright status, license type, restrictions, compliance requirements
- **Maintenance information**: update schedule, versioning strategy, retention policies, maintenance contact
- **Access requirements**: authentication needs, approval processes, costs, and barriers to access
- **Funding and grants**: sponsoring organizations, grant identifiers, acknowledgments
- **Ethics and human subjects**: IRB approval, informed consent procedures, privacy protections, vulnerable populations
- **Recommended and discouraged uses**: explicitly stated appropriate and inappropriate applications
- **Known limitations**: biases, noise, missingness, quality issues, and caveats
- **Distribution formats**: file types, compression, structure, and documentation

When multiple documentation sources describe the same dataset:
1. Merge complementary information from all sources
2. Prefer more detailed and specific information over generic descriptions
3. Keep the most comprehensive descriptions and combine metadata without duplication
4. Resolve conflicts by choosing the most authoritative or recent source

Important guidelines:

- **Generate ONLY valid YAML output** without any additional commentary, explanations, or markdown code blocks
- Ensure all required fields are populated where information is available in the source documentation
- If specific information is not available in the source documents, **omit those fields** rather than making assumptions or generating placeholder text
- Use `null` or omit fields entirely for missing information (do NOT use "Not specified", "Unknown", or similar placeholder text)
- Ensure output is syntactically valid YAML (proper indentation, quotes when needed, correct list/object structure)
- Follow the schema exactly - use correct field names, data types, and structure as specified in the schema
- For identifiers (id fields), generate descriptive, human-readable values when not provided (e.g., "dataset-name-v1", "purpose-1", "creator-john-doe")
- Maintain consistency in terminology and naming throughout the generated YAML
