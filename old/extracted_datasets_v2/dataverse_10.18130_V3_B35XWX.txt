This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.

MD5: cbdb263b1c099396d75e16f00a79a818

This dataset represents an expressed genome-scale CRISPRi Perturbation Cell Atlas in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) mapping transcriptional and fitness phenotypes associated with 11,739 targeted genes, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) Functional Genomics Grand Challenge, a component of the U.S. National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Bridge2AI program. We validated these findings via phenotypic, protein-interaction, and metabolic tracing assays.

MD5: 9422486c80bc9e1d35b2fbbc72a5f043

This data set displays the spatial localization of 563 proteins of interest in cells of the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 treated with paclitaxel as imaged by immunofluorescence-based staining (ICC-IF) and confocal microscopy in the Lundberg Lab at Stanford University, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) project. Nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue channel); endoplasmic reticulum with a calreticulin antibody (yellow channel); microtubules with tubulin antibody (red channel); and antibody against protein of interest (green channel).

                                            Dataset Description
                                            
This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.

Unpublished Dataset Preview URL

You can create a Preview URL to copy and share with others who will not need a repository account to review this unpublished dataset version. Once the dataset is published or if the URL is disabled, the URL will no longer work and will point to a "Page not found" page.
                                Only one Preview URL can be active for a single draft dataset.   
To cite this data in publications, use the datasets persistent ID instead of this URL. For more information about the Preview URL feature, please refer to the User Guide.
                                


General Preview
Create a URL that others can use to review this draft dataset version before it is published. They will be able to access all files in the dataset and see all metadata, including metadata that may identify the dataset's authors.Create General Preview URL


Anonymous Preview


Create a URL that others can use to access an anonymized view of this unpublished dataset version. Metadata that could identify the dataset's author will not be displayed. (See Tool Tip for the list of withheld metadata fields.) Non-identifying metadata will be visible.
The dataset's files are not changed and users of the Anonymous Preview URL will be able to access them. Users of the Anonymous Preview URL will not be able to see the name of the Dataverse that this dataset is in but will be able to see the name of the repository, which might expose the dataset authors' identities.To verify that all identifying information has been removed or anonymized, it is recommended that you logout and review the dataset as as it would be seen by an Anonymous Preview URL user. See User Guide for more information. 
                            You won't be able to create an Anonymous Preview URL once a version of this dataset has been published.Create Anonymous Preview URL
