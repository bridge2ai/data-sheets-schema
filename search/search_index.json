Summary All four identified gaps from the D4D pipeline analysis have been successfully addressed: \u2705 Missing Automation - Versioning workflow automated \u2705 Missing Documentation - Comprehensive versioning guide created \u2705 Incomplete Evaluation Pipeline - Verified complete (gap was incorrect) \u2705 Method Consolidation - Canonical method documented with migration guide Gap 1: Missing Automation \u2705 COMPLETED Problem Manual versioning required bash commands to copy and rename HTML files from data/d4d_html/concatenated/claudecode_agent/ to src/html/output/ with version numbers. This was error-prone and time-consuming. Solution Implemented File : project.Makefile (lines 1070-1101) Added target : make version-html VERSION=N Features : - Automates copying from generated HTML to versioned output location - Automatically renames files with version number (e.g., v6, v7, etc.) - Handles all 4 projects (AI_READI, CHORUS, CM4AI, VOICE) - Processes both human-readable and evaluation HTML files - Includes file existence checks with warnings for missing files - Provides clear next-step guidance after completion Usage : make version-html VERSION=6 Output : - Creates 8 versioned files in src/html/output/ : - D4D_-_AI-READI_v6_human_readable.html - D4D_-_AI-READI_v6_evaluation.html - D4D_-_CHORUS_v6_human_readable.html - D4D_-_CHORUS_v6_evaluation.html - D4D_-_CM4AI_v6_human_readable.html - D4D_-_CM4AI_v6_evaluation.html - D4D_-_VOICE_v6_human_readable.html - D4D_-_VOICE_v6_evaluation.html Gap 2: Missing Documentation \u2705 COMPLETED Problem No documentation existed explaining: - When to increment version number - What constitutes a version change - How to create new versions - Manual vs automated steps Solution Implemented File : docs/VERSIONING.md (new file, 262 lines) Sections included : 1. Version Numbering - Sequential integer versioning (v1, v2, v3, etc.) 2. When to Increment Versions - Clear criteria for version changes 3. Versioning Workflow - Complete step-by-step process 4.

Version Numbering D4D datasheets use sequential integer versioning (v1, v2, v3, etc.). Each version represents a stable snapshot of the datasheets published to GitHub Pages. Current Version v5 - Published December 2024 - Method: claudecode_agent (Claude Code with Task tool for parallel extraction) - Projects: AI_READI, CHORUS, CM4AI, VOICE - Location: https://bridge2ai.github.io/data-sheets-schema/html_output/ When to Increment Versions Create a new version when: Schema Changes : The D4D LinkML schema has been modified in ways that affect datasheet structure or content Source Updates : New or updated source documents are available for the Bridge2AI projects Method Improvements : The extraction/synthesis method has been significantly improved Error Corrections : Substantial errors or omissions in the current version need correction Quarterly Updates : Regular updates to keep datasheets current (recommended every 3-6 months) Do NOT create new versions for : - Minor typo fixes - CSS/styling changes only - Documentation updates - Schema changes that don't affect generated content Versioning Workflow Prerequisites Ensure you have: - Updated D4D YAML files in data/d4d_concatenated/claudecode_agent/ - Generated HTML files in data/d4d_html/concatenated/claudecode_agent/ - Validated all YAML files against the schema Step-by-Step Process 1. Regenerate D4D YAMLs (if needed) If source documents or schema have changed: # For all projects using claudecode_agent method make d4d-agent PROJECT=AI_READI make d4d-agent PROJECT=CHORUS make d4d-agent PROJECT=CM4AI make d4d-agent PROJECT=VOICE 2. Generate HTML from YAMLs make gen-d4d-html This creates HTML files in data/d4d_html/concatenated/claudecode_agent/ : - {PROJECT}_d4d_human_readable.html - Human-readable datasheet - {PROJECT}_evaluation.html - Evaluation report 3. Version the HTML Files (AUTOMATED) Use the new version-html target to automatically copy and rename files: make version-html VERSION=6 This will: - Copy HTML files from data/d4d_html/concatenated/claudecode_agent/ - Rename to versioned format: D4D_-_{PROJECT}_v6_*.html - Place in src/html/output/ directory - Create both human-readable and evaluation HTML for all 4 projects Example output: Creating v6 HTML files from claudecode_agent output... Versioning AI_READI... \u2713 Created D4D_-_AI_READI_v6_human_readable.html \u2713 Created D4D_-_AI_READI_v6_evaluation.html Versioning CHORUS... \u2713 Created D4D_-_CHORUS_v6_human_readable.html \u2713 Created D4D_-_CHORUS_v6_evaluation.html Versioning CM4AI... \u2713 Created D4D_-_CM4AI_v6_human_readable.html \u2713 Created D4D_-_CM4AI_v6_evaluation.html Versioning VOICE... \u2713 Created D4D_-_VOICE_v6_human_readable.html \u2713 Created D4D_-_VOICE_v6_evaluation.html \u2705 v6 HTML files created in src/html/output/ 4.

These were created through: Automated extraction of metadata from multiple data sources and documentation using AI Human oversight and validation by domain experts Iterative refinement to ensure completeness and accuracy Validation against the LinkML schema Rendering to multiple formats (human-readable HTML, technical LinkML HTML, and YAML) These datasheets provide comprehensive project-level metadata including dataset motivation, composition, collection processes, preprocessing, recommended uses, distribution, maintenance, ethics, and governance. GPT-5 Synthesized Datasheets The GPT-5 Synthesized Datasheets were created by: 1. Concatenating multiple project-related documents in reproducible order 2. Processing with GPT-5 to extract and synthesize D4D metadata 3. Validating against the LinkML schema 4. Rendering to human-readable HTML format These provide automated comprehensive project-level metadata and include both HTML views and downloadable YAML files. Note : HTML rendering may show incomplete data in some cases; refer to YAML source files for complete extracted metadata. Claude Code Synthesized Datasheets (Deterministic) The Claude Code Synthesized Datasheets are generated with deterministic settings for reproducibility: 1. Temperature=0.0 : Eliminates randomness in model responses 2. Pinned model version : claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929 prevents changes from model updates 3. Version-controlled prompts : Stored in external files tracked in git 4. Local schema : Uses version-controlled schema file (not remote) 5. Comprehensive metadata : Each YAML includes a metadata file tracking all generation parameters Key Features: - Reproducible: Running twice on same input produces identical output - Traceable: Complete provenance tracking via metadata files - Comparable: Can meaningfully compare with GPT-5 outputs - Transparent: All prompts and settings version-controlled and documented Metadata Files contain: - SHA-256 hashes of input file, schema, and prompts - Model settings (temperature, max_tokens) - Processing environment details - Git commit hash for provenance - Reproducibility command See DETERMINISM.md for complete details on the deterministic approach. Individual Dataset Datasheets The Individual Dataset Datasheets provide detailed metadata for specific datasets from each project's primary data repository (FAIRHub, Dataverse, PhysioNet). These focus on individual dataset instances rather than project-level metadata. Schema Information All datasheets conform to the Datasheets for Datasets framework by Gebru et al., implemented using the Bridge2AI LinkML schema .

Ontology Grounding Optimization : - Removed ConfidentialityLevelEnum mappings (Phase 5): - Removed ISO 27001 mappings (Public, Internal, Highly Confidential) - Removed NIST SP 800-60 mappings (Low Impact, Moderate Impact, High Impact) - Removed Traffic Light Protocol mappings (TLP:CLEAR, TLP:GREEN, TLP:AMBER) - Rationale: Security classification is domain-specific; prescriptive mappings may not fit all use cases - Result: ConfidentialityLevelEnum now has clear semantic descriptions without external ontology constraints - Removed CreatorOrMaintainerEnum PROV-O mappings (Phase 4): - Removed 9 prov:Agent/Person/Organization mappings from enum values - Kept schema.org mappings (schema:Person, schema:Organization, etc.) - Rationale: PROV-O redundant with schema.org, simplifies dependencies - Removed XSD mappings from VariableTypeEnum (Phase 1): - Removed 7 xsd: mappings (xsd:integer, xsd:float, xsd:double, etc.) - Kept schema.org broad_mappings for data types - Rationale: XSD adds minimal value beyond schema.org mappings - Documentation updates (Phase 7): - Updated status overview to reflect optimization - Noted which enums were simplified vs removed entirely - Removed AIActRiskEnum (Phase 9): - Removed entire AIActRiskEnum with 4 EU AI Act risk categories - Removed eu_ai_act_risk_category field from ExportControlRegulatoryRestrictions - Rationale: \"stay US-centric\" per expert feedback - Result: ComplianceStatusEnum now references HIPAA and 45 CFR 46 instead of GDPR/EU AI Act - Prefix cleanup * (Phase 10): - Note: Frictionless and CSVW prefixes were removed but no enums were affected -

Ontology Grounding Optimization : - Reduced from 40+ to 25+ standards based on expert review (Harry Caufield feedback) - Phase 1 : Removed unused/minimal standards: - VoID (Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets) - minimal usage - W3C Formats Registry - redundant with IANA Media Types - FOAF (Friend of a Friend) - replaced with schema.org - BIBO (Bibliographic Ontology) - minimal usage - OSLC (Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration) - single usage - Frictionless Data Standards - unclear benefit - XSD (XML Schema Datatypes) - removed from VariableTypeEnum (kept in schema.org mappings) - Phase 2 : Replaced PAV (Provenance, Authoring, and Versioning) with Dublin Core: - 9 PAV usages replaced with equivalent Dublin Core terms - version \u2192 dcterms:hasVersion - previousVersion \u2192 dcterms:isVersionOf - createdOn \u2192 dcterms:created - createdBy \u2192 dcterms:creator - lastUpdateOn \u2192 dcterms:modified - Phase 3 : Removed CSVW from Variables module: - 6 CSVW usages removed (Column, name, datatype, primaryKey, null, dialect) - Replaced with schema.org equivalents where needed - Phase 4 : Reduced PROV-O to essential use: - Reduced from 21 usages to 1 essential usage - Kept: was_derived_from slot (prov:wasDerivedFrom) - Removed: Agent roles (9 mappings in CreatorOrMaintainerEnum) - Removed: Redundant derivation mappings in modules - Phase 5-6 : Removed security classification mappings: - Removed ISO 27001 mappings from ConfidentialityLevelEnum - Removed NIST SP 800-60 mappings from ConfidentialityLevelEnum - Removed Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) mappings from ConfidentialityLevelEnum - Generalized regulatory compliance fields - Phase 7 : Updated standards documentation (this file) - Phase 8 : All tests pass with optimized mappings - Phase 9 : Removed GDPR and EU AI Act (US-Centric Focus): - Removed gdpr_compliant field from ExportControlRegulatoryRestrictions - Removed eu_ai_act_risk_category field from ExportControlRegulatoryRestrictions - Removed entire AIActRiskEnum enum (4 risk categories: minimal, limited, high, unacceptable) - Updated all descriptions mentioning GDPR/EU AI Act to reference US regulations (HIPAA, 45 CFR 46) - Rationale: \"stay US-centric\" per expert feedback - Phase 10 : Completed Frictionless & CSVW cleanup: - Removed frictionless prefix from D4D_Base_import.yaml and data_sheets_schema.yaml - Removed csvw prefix from D4D_Base_import.yaml and data_sheets_schema.yaml - Removed csvw:dialect mapping from dialect slot in D4D_Base_import.yaml - Rationale: \"wouldn't worry about mapping to it\" (Frictionless), \"more granular than D4D needs\" (CSVW) - Phase 11 : Validation and regeneration successful Rationale for Changes : - Eliminate redundancy (PAV overlaps with Dublin Core, FOAF overlaps with schema.org) - Remove unclear/unused ontologies (VoID, BIBO, OSLC had minimal benefit) - Simplify for maintainability (fewer external dependencies to track) - Focus on high-impact standards (DUO, schema.org, Dublin Core, DCAT) - Improve clarity (security classification is domain-specific, removed prescriptive mappings) 2025-12-01 : - Initial comprehensive standards alignment report - Documented 40+ standards across 9 categories - Added regulatory framework coverage - Included mapping statistics and interoperability benefits","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"start_date/","text":"Slot: start_date Start date of data collection URI: data_sheets_schema:start_date Alias: start_date Applicable Classes Name Description Modifies Slot CollectionTimeframe Over what timeframe was the data collected, and does this timeframe match the... no Properties Range: Date Identifier and Mapping Information Schema Source from schema: https://w3id.org/bridge2ai/data-sheets-schema Mappings Mapping Type Mapped Value self data_sheets_schema:start_date native data_sheets_schema:start_date LinkML Source name: start_date description: Start date of data collection from_schema: https://w3id.org/bridge2ai/data-sheets-schema rank: 1000 alias: start_date owner: CollectionTimeframe domain_of: -
