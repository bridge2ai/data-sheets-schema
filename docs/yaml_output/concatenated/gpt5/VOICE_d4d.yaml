title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: The Bridge2AI-Voice project provides ethically sourced, de-identified, derived representations of human voice recordings linked with demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data to enable research on voice as a biomarker of health. Participants were recruited across five North American sites into condition-focused cohorts. Public releases provide spectrograms, MFCCs, and feature summaries rather than raw audio to reduce re-identification risk.

    title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information (v1.1)"
    description: Bridge2AI-Voice v1.1 provides derived audio representations (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs, acoustic/phonetic/prosodic features) and linked phenotype/questionnaire data for 12,523 recordings from 306 adult participants recruited across five North American sites. Raw audio is not included in this release; free-speech transcripts were removed prior to release.
