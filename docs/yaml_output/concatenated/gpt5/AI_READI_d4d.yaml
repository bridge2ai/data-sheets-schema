    title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
    description: >
      The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and
      without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three data
      collection sites. It was designed with future AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)
      studies in mind, including recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving
      approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity, and
      a multi-domain data acquisition protocol (survey data, physical measurements,
      clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.). The goal is to
      better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM.
      Some non-sensitive data will be publicly downloadable upon agreement with a
      license defining permitted uses. The full dataset is accessible via a Data Use
      Agreement (DUA). Public data include survey data, blood and urine lab results,
      fitness activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g., monofilament and
      cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and
      environmental variables (e.g., home air quality). Controlled-access data
      include 5-digit ZIP code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past
      health records, medications, and traffic and accident reports. Enrollment is
      ongoing; pilot and periodic releases may not achieve balanced distributions
      across groups. Documentation versions correspond to dataset versions and
      include domain-level acquisition and processing details.
