title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >-
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a comprehensive collection of data derived from human voice
  recordings with corresponding clinical information, created to enable research
  into voice as a biomarker of health. Version 1.1 contains low-risk, derived
  features from voice waveforms (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs, acoustic and phonetic
  features) and detailed phenotype data. Original audio waveforms and free-speech
  transcripts are not included in this release to protect participant privacy.
  Data were collected using standardized multi-site protocols from adult participants
  across North American clinical sites and include demographics, validated
  questionnaires, and targeted clinical information. Access is via registered,
  controlled access with a data use agreement.
