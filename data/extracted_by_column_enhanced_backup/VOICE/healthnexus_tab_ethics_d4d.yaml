title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information (version 1.0)"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 is an ethically sourced, multi-institutional dataset for
  artificial intelligence research on voice as a biomarker of health. The initial
  release provides 12,523 recordings from 306 adult participants collected across
  five North American sites. Only low-risk derived data are released (e.g.,
  spectrograms and engineered features); original audio waveforms and free-speech
  transcripts are not included. The dataset includes detailed demographic,
  clinical, and validated questionnaire data, along with spectrograms and acoustic,
  phonetic, and prosodic features derived from standardized preprocessing.

    instance_type: recordings
    data_type: >
      Derived data including spectrogram matrices (513 x N) and acoustic/phonetic/prosodic
      features; automatic speech transcriptions were generated during processing but
      free-speech transcripts are not included in the release.
    counts: 12523
    sampling_strategies:
      - is_sample:
          - Participants were selected based on membership in predefined disease cohorts at specialty clinics across five North American sites.
        is_random:
          - Non-probabilistic, purposive cohort selection.
        source_data:
          - Patients presenting at participating specialty clinics and institutions.
        strategies:
          - Purposive sampling across disease cohorts (respiratory, voice, neurological, mood; pediatric cohort planned but not in v1.0).
  - representation: Participants
    instance_type: participants
    data_type: Demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data collected via standardized protocol.
    counts: 306
subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - Adult cohort in v1.0; participants grouped by predefined disease categories (voice disorders, neurological/neurodegenerative disorders, mood/psychiatric disorders, respiratory disorders); collected across five sites in North America.
    distribution:
      - Distribution across subpopulations not specified in this release.
is_deidentified:
  description:
    - HIPAA Safe Harbor identifiers removed (e.g., names, detailed dates, contact and ID numbers, biometric identifiers).
    - State and province removed; country of data collection retained.
    - Free-speech transcripts removed from the release.
    - Original audio waveforms omitted; only derived spectrograms and features released to reduce risk.
confidential_elements:
  description:
    - Dataset contains health-related information (demographics, clinical and questionnaire responses) released in de-identified form and considered low risk in v1.0.
sensitive_elements:
  description:
    - Health and demographic data are included; identifiers removed under HIPAA Safe Harbor and only derived audio data are released in v1.0.
acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - Voice data directly observed/recorded during clinic visits; questionnaire responses reported by participants; multiple engineered features derived from audio.
    was_directly_observed: Yes – voice recordings captured during clinic visits.
    was_reported_by_subjects: Yes – questionnaire responses.
    was_inferred_derived: Yes – spectrograms and engineered acoustic/phonetic/prosodic features; automatic transcriptions were generated.
