title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >-
  Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 is a comprehensive collection of data derived from voice
  recordings with linked clinical and demographic information to enable research
  on voice as a biomarker of health. The initial release provides 12,523
  recordings for 306 adult participants collected across five sites in North
  America. Participants were selected based on known conditions that manifest in
  the voice waveform (voice disorders, neurological/neurodegenerative disorders,
  mood/psychiatric disorders, respiratory disorders, and pediatric cohort—adult
  cohort only available in v1.0). This release contains data considered low
  risk: derived spectrograms and acoustic/phonetic/prosodic features, and
  phenotype data; raw audio waveforms and free-speech transcripts are not
  included. Access is restricted to credentialed users who complete required
  training and sign a Data Use Agreement.
