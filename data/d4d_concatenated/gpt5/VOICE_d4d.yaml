title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a multi-site project creating an ethically-sourced flagship dataset
  to enable research on the human voice as a biomarker of health. The dataset links derived
  voice representations (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs, static acoustic/phonetic features)
  to detailed demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data from adult participants
  recruited across five North American sites. Initial public releases emphasize privacy-protective
  derived data and exclude raw audio to reduce re-identification risk.

    title: Bridge2AI-Voice v1.1
    description: >
      Version 1.1 of the Bridge2AI-Voice dataset hosted on PhysioNet, providing derived
      audio representations (spectrograms, MFCCs, static features) and associated phenotype/
      questionnaire data for 12,523 recordings from 306 adult participants across five
      North American sites. Raw audio is not included in this release.
