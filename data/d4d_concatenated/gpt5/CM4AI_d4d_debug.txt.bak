title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  March 2025 Beta data release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the
  Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This release includes:
  - Perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs
  - SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes
  - Immunofluorescence (IF) subcellular images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with and without
    chemotherapy (vorinostat, paclitaxel)
  CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate
  format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data will be augmented regularly through the end of the project.
  Collaboration includes UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the
  Hastings Center. Copyright (c) 2025 The Regents of the University of California except where otherwise
