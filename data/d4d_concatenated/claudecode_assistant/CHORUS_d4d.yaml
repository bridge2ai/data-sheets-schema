title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  CHoRUS for Equitable AI is a Bridge2AI data generation project developing the most diverse,
  high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready critical care dataset to answer the grand
  challenge of improving recovery from acute illness. The project spans 20 academic centers
  (14 data acquisition centers) and creates a publicly available dataset of over 100,000
  critically ill patients with multi-modal data including structured EHR, waveform telemetry,
  medical imaging, EEG, and clinical notes. All data is standardized to the OMOP Common Data
  Model with additional formats (DICOM, WFDB, OHNLP tokenization) and includes comprehensive
  metadata schemas. Patient-focused efforts determine ethical and legal approaches to manage
  privacy and bias while accounting for Social Determinants of Health. A visualization and
  annotation environment labels data with targets important for prediction. The project
  emphasizes skills and workforce development for a next generation of diverse academic and
  community AI scientists through training programs and partnerships with AIM-AHEAD. As of
  November 2024, the dataset covers 14 different hospitals with 23,400 unique admissions.
