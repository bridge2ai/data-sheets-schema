title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: 'The CHoRUS (Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards) Network
  dataset

  is a diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready clinical dataset designed to address the

  grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness. This multi-center collaboration spans 20

  academic centers (14 as data acquisition centers) and provides harmonized multi-modal data including

  electronic health records (EHR), waveform telemetry, medical imaging, and clinical text data. The

  dataset is designed with patient-focused ethics principles, accounting for Social Determinants of

  Health, managing privacy and bias concerns, and providing unified data standards to enable AI/ML

  research for clinical care. As of November 2024, the dataset covers 14 different hospitals with 23,400

  unique admissions. Access is federated and controlled, with data stored in a secure collaborative cloud

  environment using OMOP and other international standards.'
