title: Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI)
description: >
  The AI-READI is a flagship dataset consisting of multimodal data collected from 4,000 individuals
  with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across 3 data collection sites
  (Birmingham, Alabama; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington). The dataset was designed with
  future AI/Machine Learning studies in mind, including recruitment sampling procedures aimed at
  achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity (triple-balanced
  by race/ethnicity, biological sex, and T2DM severity), as well as a multi-domain data acquisition
  protocol (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, retinal imaging, wearable device data,
  environmental sensors, biospecimens) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible
  with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data. The goal is to better
  understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. The study follows FAIR
  principles and incorporates ethical and equitable data collection and management practices.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: purpose-001
    description: >
      Better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
      using a hypothesis-agnostic, harmonized, multi-domain dataset designed specifically for AI/ML
      research. The dataset aims to provide critical insights into how individuals can transition from
      diabetes toward health resilience through pseudotime manifold analysis of participants at different
      disease severity stages.
  - id: purpose-002
    description: >
      Establish standards, best practices, and guidelines for collection, preparation, and sharing of
      medical/health data sets targeted for AI/ML applications. This includes guidance from bioethicists
      on ethical and equitable data collection and management practices, with adherence to FAIR principles
      (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).
  - id: purpose-003
    description: >
      Address the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in T2DM research by creating a dataset that is
      triple-balanced across race/ethnicity (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White), biological sex (male,
      female), and diabetes severity (no diabetes, pre-diabetes/lifestyle-controlled, medication-controlled,
      insulin-controlled). This addresses demographic inequities in many previous epidemiological studies
      and clinical trials.
  - id: purpose-004
    description: >
      Create a flagship biomedical dataset as part of the NIH Bridge2AI program that is ethically sourced,
      trustworthy, well-defined and publicly available to facilitate the widespread use of AI/ML approaches
      in diabetes research and beyond.

tasks:
  - id: task-001
    description: >
      Enable multi-domain AI/ML analyses for T2DM by collecting data across survey, clinical, imaging,
      wearable device, environmental, and biospecimen domains that may not be feasible with existing data
      sources such as claims or electronic health records data alone. The multimodal nature of the data
      supports complex machine learning model development and training.
  - id: task-002
    description: >
      Support the development of unbiased machine learning models through balanced data collection across
      demographic groups and diabetes severity levels. The triple-balanced design is critical for preventing
      algorithmic bias in AI/ML applications and ensuring health equity.
  - id: task-003
    description: >
      Study disease trajectories and salutogenesis pathways in T2DM through cross-sectional analysis of
      participants at different disease stages, enabling pseudotime manifold analysis to predict disease
      progression and paths to health resilience. Data collection is specifically designed to permit
      downstream pseudotime manifold analysis by collecting data from participants with differing disease
      severity.
  - id: task-004
    description: >
      Recruit and train a diverse biomedical AI/ML workforce by increasing access to and quality of AI/ML
      research. The project includes skills and workforce development components to train personnel in
      AI-ready dataset generation and analysis.

addressing_gaps:
  - id: gap-001
    description: >
      Provide the largest publicly accessible multimodal T2DM dataset with 4,000 participants and over
      10 variable domains, enabling AI/ML analyses not feasible with existing sources (e.g., claims or
      EHR alone). Previous datasets lacked the combination of scale, diversity, and multimodal depth
      needed for comprehensive AI/ML research.
  - id: gap-002
    description: >
      Address demographic underrepresentation in T2DM research by recruiting equal proportions across four
      race/ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White) and both biological sexes. A meta-epidemiological
      review of T2DM studies published from 2000 to 2020 indicated that samples lacked racial and ethnic
      diversity, making AI-READI an important step forward in addressing these demographic inequities.
  - id: gap-003
    description: >
      Create a model for future AI-ready medical datasets through comprehensive metadata, standardized
      data formats (OMOP CDM for clinical data, DICOM for imaging, mHealth standards for wearables),
      FAIR compliance, and ethical data governance practices that can be replicated for other health
      conditions.

  - id: subset-012
    description: >
      Biorepository Specimens: Blood derivatives including buffy coats (for DNA extractions and future
      genomics), genomic DNA, EDTA plasma (for future proteomics and metabolomics), serum (for future
      proteomics and metabolomics), PAXgene vacutainers (for future RNA isolations and gene expression

sampling_strategies:
  - id: sampling-001
    description: >
      Triple-Balanced Sampling Design: Purposive recruitment to achieve approximately equal distribution
      across three dimensions: (1) four race/ethnic groups (Asian, Black, Hispanic, White), (2) four
      categories of T2DM severity (no diabetes, pre-diabetes/lifestyle-controlled diabetes, diabetes treated
      with oral medications or non-insulin injections, insulin-controlled diabetes), and (3) two biological
      sexes (male, female). Building balanced data sets is critical for development of unbiased machine
      learning models. Rather than targeting demographic distribution of US population, study recruits
      equal proportions across all groups.
  - id: sampling-002
    description: >
      Multi-Site Geographic Sampling: Recruitment across three geographically diverse data collection
      sites (Birmingham, Alabama; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington) to capture regional diversity.
      All study groups recruited from each site, but proportion of each group varies depending on demographic
      prevalence in each site's geographical area.
  - id: sampling-003
    description: >
      Wave-Based Recruitment: Participants recruited in waves to facilitate efficient sampling and allow
      coordinators to respond to interested persons with expediency. Composition and size of each wave
      influenced by observed participation characteristics of race/ethnicity, gender, severity of T2DM,
      and site according to health records. As recruitment progresses, composition monitored for diversity
      and inclusion and adjusted by under- and oversampling groups as needed.

    year of enrollment, sites on schedule for reaching final sample of 4,000 within three years of data
    collection. As enrollment is ongoing, pilot data release and periodic updates may not have achieved
    balanced distribution across groups yet. Final dataset expected late 2026 or early 2027. Long-term
    preservation plans through FAIRhub platform and NIH data repositories.
