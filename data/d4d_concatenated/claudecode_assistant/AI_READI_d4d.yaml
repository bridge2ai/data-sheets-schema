title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: 'The AI-READI (Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights)
  dataset

  consists of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM),

  harmonized across 3 data collection sites (University of Washington, University of Alabama at

  Birmingham, and University of California San Diego). The composition was designed with future

  AI/Machine Learning studies in mind, including recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving

  triple-balanced distribution (race/ethnicity, diabetes severity, biological sex) and a multi-domain

  data acquisition protocol (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable

  device data, environmental sensors) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses. Target enrollment is 4,000

  participants with approximately 400 participants in longitudinal follow-up. The goal is to better

  understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM through pseudotime manifold

  analysis.'

purposes:
- description: 'Create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial

    intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2

    diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health. Develop a

    foundational dataset in diabetes, agnostic to existing classification criteria, which can

    be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health.'
tasks:
