title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI)
description: >
  CM4AI is the Functional Genomics Data Generation Project in the U.S. National Institutes of Health's
  (NIH) Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program. Its overarching mission is to produce
  ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell architecture, inferred from multimodal data collected for human
  cell lines, to enable transformative biomedical AI research. The project delivers machine-readable
  hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data produced from multimodal interrogation of
  100 chromatin modifiers and 100 metabolic enzymes involved in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac
  disorders in disease-relevant cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. Data streams
  include immunofluorescence (IF) subcellular microscopy for spatial proteomics, affinity purification
  mass spectroscopy (AP-MS) and size exclusion mass spectroscopy (SEC-MS) for protein-protein
  interaction (PPI) data, and single-cell CRISPR-Cas perturbation screens by cell type. Input data
  streams are integrated via the Multi-Scale Integrated Cell (MuSIC) software pipeline employing deep
  learning models and community detection algorithms, and output cell maps are packaged with provenance
  graphs and rich metadata as AI-Ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: purpose-001
    description: >
      Deliver machine-readable hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data from multimodal
      interrogation of disease-relevant cell lines to enable transformative biomedical AI research.
      CM4AI produces integrated cell maps from spatial proteomics, protein-protein interactions, and
      genetic perturbations using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, cell imaging, and CRISPR
      technologies.
  - id: purpose-002
    description: >
      Address the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning in genomics and
      precision medicine. Machine learning models are often black boxes predicting phenotypes from
      genotypes without understanding the mechanisms. CM4AI enables visible machine learning systems
      informed by multi-scale cell and tissue architecture, allowing AI tools to interrogate how
      protein assemblies in the cell affect cell-level phenotype predictions.
  - id: purpose-003
    description: >
      Establish standards, best practices, and guidelines for ethical AI-readiness in biomedical data.
      This includes implementing FAIR principles, computing machine-readable provenance graphs,
      characterizing and validating all datasets with JSON-Schema mini-data-dictionaries, and mapping
      data elements to public ontology vocabularies where appropriate.
  - id: purpose-004
    description: >
      Enable development of visible neural networks (VNNs) and visible machine learning tools that
      use hierarchical cell maps as interpretable structures for AI model architectures, allowing
      interrogation of how protein assemblies affect cell-level phenotypes and interpretation of
      genetic variants and mutations.

      Address the limitation that machine learning models in genomics and precision medicine are
      typically difficult-to-interpret black boxes by providing hierarchical cell maps that enable
      visible machine learning systems built directly on knowledge maps of cell and tissue architecture.

# Maintenance
updates:
  id: updates-001
  name: Quarterly Data Releases and Augmentation
  description: >
    Dataset regularly updated and augmented through the end of the project in November 2026. Updates on
    a quarterly basis. Current releases are interim beta releases with some datasets under temporary
    pre-publication embargo. Computed cell maps will be added in future releases. Dataset versioned with
    major and minor releases tracked in Dataverse. March 2025 release (V1) and June 2025 release (V2)
    with corrections to ro-crate metadata and naming conventions. All versions preserved with DOIs for
    reproducibility. Long-term preservation in the University of Virginia Dataverse, supported by
    committed institutional funds.
  frequency: Quarterly updates through November 2026
  update_details:
    - Quarterly data releases with version tracking
    - March 2025 release (V1) - Initial beta release
    - June 2025 release (V2) - Corrections and RGB images

# Human Subjects Information

  name: CM4AI Non-Clinical Cell Line Data
  description: >
    CM4AI data are distinctive within Bridge2AI in that they are non-clinical (from tissue cultures)
    and are considered to be de-identified as they cannot be matched, with current knowledge, to a human
    subject. Data derived from commercially available de-identified human cell lines: MDA-MB-468 breast
    cancer cells (ATCC, RRID:CVCL_0419) and KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cells (HipSci,
    RRID:CVCL_B5P3). No direct human subjects research. FDA Regulated: No. Ethically sourced cell lines
    with appropriate material transfer agreements. Ethics team employs Value-Sensitive Design (VSD)
    methodology, CM4AI Life Cycle framework, and mixed empirical research to ensure responsible design
    of datasets and AI technologies.
