title: Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI)
description: >
  The AI-READI is a flagship dataset consisting of multimodal data collected from 4,000 individuals
  with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across 3 data collection sites
  (Birmingham, Alabama; San Diego, California; Seattle, Washington). The dataset was designed
  with future AI/Machine Learning studies in mind, including recruitment sampling procedures
  aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity
  (triple-balanced by race/ethnicity, biological sex, and T2DM severity), as well as a
  multi-domain data acquisition protocol (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data,
  imaging data, wearable device data, environmental sensors, biospecimens) to enable downstream
  AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic
  health records data. The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease
  to health) in T2DM. The study follows FAIR principles and incorporates ethical and equitable
  data collection and management practices.

    description: >
      Better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus using a hypothesis-agnostic, harmonized, multi-domain dataset designed specifically
      for AI/ML research. The dataset aims to provide critical insights into how individuals can
      transition from diabetes toward health resilience.
  - id: purpose-002
    name: Establishing AI/ML data standards
    description: >

      guidance from bioethicists on ethical and equitable data collection and management
      practices, with adherence to FAIR principles.
  - id: purpose-003
    name: Addressing demographic inequities in T2DM research
    description: >
      Address the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in T2DM research by creating a dataset
