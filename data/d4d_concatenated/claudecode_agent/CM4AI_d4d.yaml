title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI)
description: >
  CM4AI is the Functional Genomics Data Generation Project in the U.S. National Institutes of Health's
  (NIH) Bridge to Artificial Intelligence (Bridge2AI) program. Its overarching mission is to produce
  ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell architecture, inferred from multimodal data collected for human
  cell lines, to enable transformative biomedical AI research. The project delivers machine-readable
  hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data produced from multimodal interrogation of
  100 chromatin modifiers and 100 metabolic enzymes involved in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac
  disorders in disease-relevant cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. Data streams
  include immunofluorescence (IF) subcellular microscopy for spatial proteomics, affinity purification
  mass spectroscopy (AP-MS) and size exclusion mass spectroscopy (SEC-MS) for protein-protein
  interaction (PPI) data, and single-cell CRISPR-Cas perturbation screens by cell type. Input data
  streams are integrated via the Multi-Scale Integrated Cell (MuSIC) software pipeline employing deep
  learning models and community detection algorithms, and output cell maps are packaged with provenance
  graphs and rich metadata as AI-Ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: purpose-001
    name: AI-Ready Cell Architecture Maps for Biomedical AI
    description: >
      Deliver machine-readable hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data from multimodal
      interrogation of disease-relevant cell lines to enable transformative biomedical AI research.
      CM4AI produces integrated cell maps from spatial proteomics, protein-protein interactions, and
      genetic perturbations using state-of-the-art mass spectrometry, cell imaging, and CRISPR
      technologies.
  - id: purpose-002
    name: Interpretable Genotype-Phenotype Learning
    description: >
      Address the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning in genomics and
      precision medicine. Machine learning models are often "black boxes" predicting phenotypes from
      genotypes without understanding the mechanisms. CM4AI enables "visible" machine learning systems
      informed by multi-scale cell and tissue architecture, allowing AI tools to interrogate how
      protein assemblies in the cell affect cell-level phenotype predictions.
  - id: purpose-003
    name: Establishing AI-Readiness Standards for Biomedical Data
    description: >
      Establish standards, best practices, and guidelines for ethical AI-readiness in biomedical data.
      This includes implementing FAIR principles, computing machine-readable provenance graphs,
      characterizing and validating all datasets with JSON-Schema mini-data-dictionaries, and mapping
      data elements to public ontology vocabularies where appropriate.

    name: Black Box AI Models in Genomic Medicine
    description: >
      Address the limitation that machine learning models in genomics and precision medicine are
      typically difficult-to-interpret "black boxes" by providing hierarchical cell maps that enable
      visible machine learning systems built directly on knowledge maps of cell and tissue architecture.
  - id: gap-002

# Ethics and Human Subjects

  description: >
    CM4AI data are distinctive within Bridge2AI in that they are non-clinical data from tissue cultures
    and are considered to be de-identified as they cannot be matched, with current knowledge, to a human
    subject. Both cell lines (MDA-MB-468 and KOLF2.1J) are commercially available, ethically sourced,
    de-identified cell lines. MDA-MB-468 available from ATCC. KOLF2.1J available from HipSci resource
    for non-profit organizations via simple MTA. Ethics team developed comprehensive plan for ethical
    preparation, licensing, dissemination, and data access supervision balancing openness with IP
    protection and commercialization monitoring.
