title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
  (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI
  program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J
  iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons,
  and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence
  and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI's objective is to
  deliver machine-readable hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data
  produced from multimodal interrogation of 100 chromatin modifiers and 100 metabolic
  enzymes involved in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac disorders in disease-relevant
  cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. CM4AI output data are packaged
  with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format
  using the FAIRSCAPE framework. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA,
  Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: cm4ai:purpose:ai-ready-maps
    name: Create AI-ready cell architecture maps
    description: >
      Create AI-ready maps of human cell architecture from disease-relevant cell
      lines as part of the NIH Bridge2AI Functional Genomics Grand Challenge to
      enable transformative biomedical AI research.
    response: >
      CM4AI's overarching mission is to produce ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell
      architecture, inferred from multimodal data collected for human cell lines, to
      enable transformative biomedical AI research. The project aims to ethically
      leverage state-of-the-art computational and experimental tools in biomedical
      science to enable a new generation of transformative artificial intelligence
      research to benefit humanity.

  - id: cm4ai:purpose:interpretable-genotype-phenotype
    name: Enable interpretable genotype-phenotype learning
    description: >
      Enable interpretable genotype-phenotype learning by providing visible machine
      learning systems informed by multi-scale cell architecture.
    response: >
      The CM4AI project seeks to map the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells
      and use these maps toward the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype
      learning. In genomics and precision medicine, machine learning models are often
      black boxes, predicting phenotypes from genotypes without understanding the
      mechanisms. CM4AI addresses this deficiency through coordinated effort involving
      proteomic mass spectrometry, cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation via
      CRISPR/Cas9 to create visible machine learning systems.

tasks:
  - id: cm4ai:task:cell-mapping
    name: Hierarchical cell mapping
    description: >
      Create hierarchical directed acyclic graph (DAG) maps where each node represents
      an assembly of proteins in proximity at a given scale, spanning from large
      assemblies representing cell compartments to small assemblies of proteins in
      close proximity.
    response: >
      Cell maps are hierarchical directed acyclic graphs (DAG), where each node
      represents an assembly of proteins in proximity at a given scale, spanning from
      large assemblies representing cell compartments (e.g., nucleus, mitochondria)
      to small assemblies of proteins in close proximity (e.g., protein complexes or
      subunits). These maps are produced by integrating localization and interaction
      data using self-supervised embedding approaches from deep learning, followed by
      algorithmic community detection at multiple resolutions.

  - id: cm4ai:task:multimodal-integration
    name: Multimodal data integration
    description: >
      Integrate three complementary mapping approaches - proteomic mass spectrometry,
      cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation - to create comprehensive maps of
      cellular structure and function.
    response: >
      The project launches a coordinated effort involving three complementary mapping
      approaches: affinity purification-mass spectrometry (AP-MS) and size-exclusion
      mass spectroscopy (SEC-MS) for protein interaction networks; immunofluorescence
      (IF) staining and high-resolution microscopy for protein localization; and
      single-cell CRISPR-Cas perturbation screens for genetic perturbation mapping.
      These data streams are integrated via the MuSIC (Multi-Scale Integrated Cell)
      software pipeline employing deep learning models and community detection algorithms.

  - id: cm4ai:task:ai-readiness
    name: AI-readiness packaging
    description: >
      Package datasets with FAIR compliance, provenance graphs, complete schemas,
      validation procedures, datasheets, and ethical documentation to ensure AI-readiness.
    response: >
      AI-Ready biomedical data are fully characterized FAIR data of known provenance,
      which can be ethically and reliably processed by AI applications. CM4AI uses
      the FAIRSCAPE framework to establish AI-readiness through: (a) FAIRness including
      rich metadata and persistent globally unique identifiers; (b) machine-readable
      provenance graphs resolvable as metadata for all results; and (c) characterization
      and validation of all datasets using JSON-Schema descriptions resolvable from
      provenance graph metadata.

addressing_gaps:
  - id: cm4ai:gap:black-box-ml
    name: Address black-box machine learning
    description: >
      Address the limitation of black-box machine learning models in genomics by
      creating visible neural networks built on knowledge maps of cell architecture.
    response: >
      Machine learning models show great promise in analyzing the human genome but
      their inner workings are typically difficult-to-interpret black boxes. CM4AI
      provides matched data and tools to enable the creation of visible ML systems,
      which are built directly on knowledge maps of cell and tissue architecture
      rather than being opaque black boxes. Cell maps have been used in AI tools for
      visible machine learning or visible neural networks (VNNs) to interrogate how
      protein assemblies affect cell-level phenotype predictions.

  - id: cm4ai:gap:fair-ai-datasets
    name: Provide FAIR AI-ready functional genomics datasets
    description: >
      Fill the gap in availability of high-quality, FAIR, AI-ready functional genomics
      datasets with rich metadata, provenance graphs, and ethical documentation.
    response: >
      CM4AI addresses the need for ethical, FAIR, AI-Ready biomedical data that are
      fully characterized with known provenance, can be ethically and reliably processed
      by AI applications, and whose predictions may be fully explained and interpreted.
      The project provides datasets packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata
      in RO-Crate format using FAIRSCAPE framework, with complete schemas, validation
      procedures, and datasheets.
