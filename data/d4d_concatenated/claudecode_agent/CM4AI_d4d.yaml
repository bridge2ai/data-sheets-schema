title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) Data Generation Project
description: >
  The Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) is a NIH-funded Bridge to Artificial
  Intelligence (Bridge2AI) Data Generation Project in the area of Functional Genomics.
  CM4AI's objective is to deliver machine-readable hierarchical maps of cell architecture
  as AI-Ready data produced from multimodal interrogation of 100 chromatin modifiers and
  100 metabolic enzymes involved in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac disorders in
  disease-relevant cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. The dataset uses
  state-of-the-art mass spectrometry based proteomics (AP-MS, SEC-MS), spatial proteomics
  via immunofluorescence cell imaging, and genetic perturbations using CRISPR/Cas9. Cell
  lines under investigation include treated and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell
  lines (paclitaxel and vorinostat), and differentiated neurons and cardiomyocytes generated
  from NIH-iPCS-1 KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs). CM4AI's software
  pipeline and AI-readiness framework provide important enabling capabilities for this work,
  packaging data with provenance graphs and rich metadata in RO-Crate format using the
  FAIRSCAPE framework.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: cm4ai:purpose:001
    description: >
      Produce ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell architecture inferred from multimodal data
      collected for human cell lines to enable transformative biomedical AI research. The
      project aims to map the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these maps
      toward the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning.
  - id: cm4ai:purpose:002
    description: >
      Address the deficiency of "black box" machine learning models in genomics and precision
      medicine by creating large-scale maps of cellular structure/function across demographic
      and disease contexts. These maps enable "visible" machine learning systems informed by
      multi-scale cell and tissue architecture where predictions can be explained through
      knowledge of biological mechanisms.
  - id: cm4ai:purpose:003
    description: >
      Establish standards, best practices, and guidelines for AI-ready biomedical data through
      the FAIRSCAPE framework, providing fully characterized FAIR data of known provenance that
      can be ethically and reliably processed by AI applications with models and software
      available for validation and re-use.

tasks:
  - id: cm4ai:task:001
    description: >
      Enable development of visible machine learning (VNN) tools that interrogate how protein
      assemblies in the cell affect cell-level phenotype predictions. Cell maps provide a
      foundation for downstream applications in human genomics, including interpretation of
      genetic variants and mutations.
  - id: cm4ai:task:002
    description: >
      Support multi-modal data integration for functional genomics by combining protein
      interaction networks (AP-MS, SEC-MS), protein localization and distribution (IF imaging),
      and transcriptional states (CRISPR perturbation screens) to generate comprehensive
      hierarchical maps of cell architecture.
  - id: cm4ai:task:003
    description: >
      Facilitate AI/ML research in disease-relevant contexts by studying chromatin regulators
      and metabolic enzymes in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac disorders under both
      perturbed and unperturbed conditions.

addressing_gaps:
  - id: cm4ai:gap:001
    description: >
      Provide interpretable AI/ML models that address the "black box" problem in genomics
      and precision medicine by building models directly on knowledge maps of cell and tissue
      architecture rather than learning genotype-phenotype relationships without understanding
      mechanisms.
  - id: cm4ai:gap:002
    description: >
      Create a library of large-scale, multi-modal cell maps not previously available, enabling
      research into cellular structure/function relationships across disease contexts that
      cannot be achieved with single-modality datasets.
  - id: cm4ai:gap:003
    description: >
      Establish a model for ethical, FAIR, and AI-ready biomedical datasets through comprehensive
      metadata, provenance graphs, standardized formats, and data governance practices that can
      be replicated for other biomedical domains beyond functional genomics.

    description: >
      Primary intended use is development of visible machine learning (VNN) tools for interpretable
      AI/ML in genomics and precision medicine. Cell maps provide hierarchical structure for
      VNNs where nodes represent protein assemblies spanning from large compartments (nucleus,
      mitochondria) to small protein complexes, enabling "visible neural networks" that are not
      black boxes but built directly on knowledge maps.

    description: >
      AI/ML model training for functional genomics applications including interpretation of genetic
      variants, mutation effects, drug response prediction, and disease trajectory modeling.
      Cell maps used in visible machine learning approaches for hypothesis-agnostic analysis
      of genotype-phenotype relationships.
  - id: cm4ai:use:003
    description: >
      Research into cellular processes, protein complex formation, and cell architectural changes
      in presence of disease processes (cancer), treatment conditions (chemotherapy), or genetic
      perturbations (CRISPR). Multi-modal integration enables study of structure-function
      relationships not feasible with single-modality data.

  description: >
    Dataset regularly updated and augmented through end of project November 2026. Quarterly
    release schedule with versions tracked (currently V1.4 March 2025, V2.1 June 2025). Long-term
    preservation in University of Virginia Dataverse (LibraData) supported by committed institutional
    funds. Updates include additional proteins imaged, additional genes tagged for AP-MS,
    SEC-MS data from additional cell types and conditions, computed cell maps from MuSIC
    pipeline integration, and corrections to metadata and naming conventions.
  frequency: Quarterly releases; final release planned November 2026
  update_details:
    - Beta release March 2025 (V1) with perturb-seq, SEC-MS, IF images
    - Beta release June 2025 (V2) added RGB IF images, metadata corrections
    - Quarterly updates through November 2026
    - Computed cell maps to be added in future releases
    - Additional protein coverage ongoing (17/51 genes tagged, 34 more in process)
    - SEC-MS expansion to additional cell types and conditions
    - Long-term preservation in UVA Dataverse

retention_limit:
  id: cm4ai:retention:001
  description: >
    Digital data maintained according to NIH data sharing policies with long-term preservation
    commitment from University of Virginia institutional funds. Dataverse repository provides
    persistent storage with ARK persistent identifiers resolving to metadata and data. Some
    datasets under temporary pre-publication embargo. No planned deletion date. Cell line
    materials available through commercial sources (ATCC for MDA-MB-468, HipSci for KOLF2.1J).
  retention_details:
    - NIH data sharing policies govern retention
    - UVA institutional funds committed for long-term preservation
    - ARK persistent identifiers ensure permanent resolvability
    - Temporary pre-publication embargo on some datasets
    - No planned data deletion
    - Source cell lines commercially available

# Ethics and Human Subjects

  name: CM4AI Human Subjects Research
  description: >
    Dataset uses commercially available, ethically sourced, de-identified cell lines that cannot
    be matched to human subjects with current knowledge. Non-clinical data from tissue cultures.
    MDA-MB-468 and KOLF2.1J cell lines obtained through established commercial and academic
    sources (ATCC, HipSci) with appropriate material transfer agreements. No human subjects
    involved in data collection. Ethics team employed Value-Sensitive Design (VSD) methodology
    to create normative standards and expectations for responsible design of datasets and AI
    technologies. CM4AI Life Cycle framework designed to elucidate governance milestones
    throughout data generation and AI system development. No IRB approval required for use of
    de-identified commercial cell lines.
