title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  The CHoRUS Network dataset is a diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready
  clinical dataset designed to address the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute
  illness. This multi-center collaboration spans 20 academic centers (14 as data acquisition
  centers) and provides harmonized multi-modal data including electronic health records (EHR),
  waveform telemetry, medical imaging, and clinical text data. The dataset is designed with
  patient-focused ethics principles, accounting for Social Determinants of Health, managing
  privacy and bias concerns, and providing unified data standards to enable AI/ML research
  for clinical care. As of November 2024, the dataset covers 14 different hospitals with
  23,400 unique admissions. Access is federated and controlled, with data stored in a secure
  collaborative cloud environment using OMOP and other international standards. Program leads
  include Eric Rosenthal (MGH), Azra Bihorac (UF), Xiaoqian Jiang (UT Health), Yulia Strekalova (UF),
  Parisa Rashidi (UF), and Andrew Williams (Tufts). Contact dbold@emory.edu or
  jared.houghtaling@tuftsmedicine.org for data access.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - description: >
      Develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready dataset to
      answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness across diverse
      patient populations, with specific attention to diversity, equity, and ethical sourcing
      through patient-focused frameworks accounting for Social Determinants of Health.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Support AI/ML model development and validation for clinical care applications,
      particularly for prediction and decision support related to acute illness recovery,
      with emphasis on diverse patient populations and multi-modal data integration across
      EHR, waveforms, imaging, and clinical text.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Existing clinical datasets often lack diversity, multi-modal integration, or ethical
      frameworks addressing bias and Social Determinants of Health. CHoRUS fills this gap
      by providing diverse, high-resolution multi-modal clinical data (EHR, waveforms, imaging,
      text) harmonized across 14 hospitals with explicit ethical frameworks and partnership
      with AIM-AHEAD to address health disparities.

# Composition
instances:
  - description: >
      Individual hospital admissions for patients experiencing acute illness. Each admission
      represents an instance with associated multi-modal data including demographics, diagnoses,
      procedures, medications, nursing flowsheets, clinical notes (tokenized via OHNLP),
      imaging (DICOM), waveform telemetry (WFDB format), and EEG data (EDF+/Persyst). As of
      November 2024, the dataset includes 23,400 unique admissions from 14 hospitals. Data
      types follow international standards including OMOP for structured EHR data, WFDB for
      waveforms, DICOM for imaging, and OHNLP for clinical text.
