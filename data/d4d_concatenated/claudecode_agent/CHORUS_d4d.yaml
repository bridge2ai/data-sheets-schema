title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  The CHoRUS (Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards) for Equitable AI is a flagship Bridge2AI dataset
  designed to improve recovery from acute illness through the creation of the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically
  sourced, AI-ready clinical dataset. This multicenter collaboration spans 20 academic centers (14 as data acquisition
  centers) and harmonizes multi-modal Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, physiological waveforms, clinical imaging,
  and text data using unified international standards (OMOP, DICOM, WFDB, EDF+). As of November 2024, the dataset
  covers 14 different hospitals with 23,400 unique patient admissions. The project emphasizes patient-focused ethical
  and legal approaches to manage privacy and bias while accounting for Social Determinants of Health. A visualization
  and annotation environment enables data labeling with clinically important prediction targets. Federated access
  mechanisms ensure balanced and diverse cohort representation. The dataset is available under controlled access with
  licensing agreements required for all users. CHoRUS collaborates with the Bridge2AI program and three other data
  generation projects to advance equitable AI in clinical care.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - id: chorus:purpose:001
    name: Improve recovery from acute illness
    response: >
      Develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready dataset to answer the grand
      challenge of improving recovery from acute illness. This addresses a critical gap in clinical AI research
      where existing datasets lack the diversity, resolution, and ethical framework necessary for equitable
      AI model development.

  - id: chorus:purpose:002
    name: Establish unified clinical data standards
    response: >
      Harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data using unified international standards
      (OMOP for EHR, DICOM for imaging, WFDB for waveforms, EDF+ for EEG, OHNLP for clinical notes).
      Provide validated semantic mappings connecting clinical data in various source formats to these
      international standards, enabling interoperability across institutions.

  - id: chorus:purpose:003
    name: Advance health equity through diverse AI
    response: >
      Create a balanced and diverse cohort that accounts for Social Determinants of Health, enabling
      development of AI models that work equitably across different patient populations. Address bias
      in clinical AI by ensuring representation of underrepresented communities in biomedical research.

tasks:
  - id: chorus:task:001
    name: Clinical prediction from multimodal data
    response: >
      Enable AI/ML applications for clinical prediction tasks using integrated multi-modal data including
      demographics, medications, procedures, diagnoses, nursing flowsheets, clinical notes, imaging,
      waveform telemetry, and EEG. Support development of models for improving patient outcomes in
      acute care settings.

  - id: chorus:task:002
    name: Federated data access and analysis
    response: >
      Provide federated access mechanisms enabling sampling methods to ensure balanced and diverse cohort
      selection for AI model training and validation. Support distributed analytics while maintaining

    name: Lack of diverse multimodal acute care datasets
    response: >
      Address the absence of large-scale, diverse, high-resolution clinical datasets for acute illness
      that combine EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data. With 14 hospitals and 23,400 admissions,
      CHoRUS provides unprecedented diversity and scale for acute care AI research.

  - id: chorus:gap:002
    name: Clinical data standardization barriers
    response: >
      Overcome fragmentation in clinical data standards by providing comprehensive standard operating
      protocols (SOPs), validated semantic mappings, and open-source tooling for data extraction,
      transformation, and harmonization. Enable institutions to contribute interoperable datasets.

  - id: chorus:gap:003
    name: Ethical and privacy frameworks for clinical AI
    response: >
      Establish patient-focused ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy, bias, and Social
      Determinants of Health in clinical AI datasets. Provide reusable frameworks for consent,
