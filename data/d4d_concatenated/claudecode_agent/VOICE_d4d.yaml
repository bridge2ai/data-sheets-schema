title: Bridge2AI-Voice - An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information
description: >
  The Bridge2AI-Voice project seeks to create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to enable
  future research in artificial intelligence and support critical insights into the use of voice
  as a biomarker of health. The human voice contains complex acoustic markers which have been
  linked to important health conditions including dementia, mood disorders, and cancer. When viewed
  as a biomarker, voice is a promising characteristic to measure as it is simple to collect,
  cost-effective, and has broad clinical utility. This comprehensive collection provides voice
  recordings with corresponding clinical information from participants selected based on known
  conditions which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological
  disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders. The dataset is designed to fuel voice AI
  research, establish data standards, and promote ethical and trustworthy AI/ML development for
  voice biomarkers of health. Data collection occurs through a multi-institutional collaborative
  effort using standardized protocols, custom smartphone applications, and rigorous ethical
  oversight. The initial release (v1.0) provides 12,523 recordings for 306 participants collected
  across five sites in North America, with derived features such as spectrograms, MFCCs, acoustic
  features, and clinical phenotype data. Raw audio data is available through controlled access
  to protect participant privacy.

    Data collection and sharing approved by University of South Florida Institutional Review
    Board. Participants provided written informed consent for data collection initiative and
    data sharing. Consent process includes authorization for voice data collection, access to
    medical information through EHR platforms for gold standard validation, and permission to
    share research data. Bioethics guidance integrated throughout study design and conduct.
    Ethics module develops new guidelines for consenting to voice data collection, voice data
    sharing, and utilization in context of voice AI technology. Project addresses ethical and
    trustworthy issues from voice data generation and AI/ML research through clinical adoption
    and downstream health decisions.
