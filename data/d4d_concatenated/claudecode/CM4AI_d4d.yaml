title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - AI-Ready Maps of Human Cell Architecture from Disease-Relevant Cell Lines
description: >
  The Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) dataset consists of machine-readable hierarchical
  maps of cell architecture derived from multimodal interrogation of 100 chromatin modifiers and
  100 metabolic enzymes involved in cancer, neuropsychiatric, and cardiac disorders in disease-relevant
  cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions. The project uses state-of-the-art mass
  spectrometry based proteomics, spatial proteomics/cell imaging, and genetic perturbations using
  CRISPR to generate cell maps packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-Ready datasets
  in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Cell lines include treated (paclitaxel, vorinostat)
  versus untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells, and undifferentiated vs. differentiated (neurons,
  cardiomyocytes) NIH-iPCS-1 KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSCs).
