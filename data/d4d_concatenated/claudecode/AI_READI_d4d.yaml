title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: >
  The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and without
  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites.
  The composition was designed with future AI/Machine Learning studies in mind,
  including recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal
  distribution of participants across diabetes severity, as well as a multi-domain
  data acquisition protocol (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data,
  imaging data, wearable device data, etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses
  that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic
  health records data. The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway
  from disease to health) in T2DM.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - description: >
      Better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in
      Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus using a harmonized, multi-domain dataset designed
      for AI/ML research.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Enable downstream AI/ML analyses across survey, clinical, imaging, wearable,
      and environmental domains related to T2DM that may not be feasible with
      existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Provide a harmonized, multi-site, multi-domain dataset enabling AI/ML
      analyses not feasible with existing sources (e.g., claims or EHR alone),
      with recruitment targeting approximately equal distribution by diabetes severity.

# Composition
instances:
  - description: >
      Individual participants with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
      with multi-domain measurements including survey responses, physical and
      clinical measurements, blood and urine lab results, retinal imaging, ECG,
      wearable device time-series, blood glucose levels, and environmental
      sensor data (e.g., home air quality).

sampling_strategies:
  - description: >
      Recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal
      distribution of participants across diabetes severity.
    is_sample:
      - true
    is_random:
      - false
    is_representative:
      - false
    strategies:
      - Targeted recruitment to balance diabetes severity across participant groups

subpopulations:
  - description: >
      Participants with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, stratified by
      diabetes severity. Recruitment aimed at approximately equal distribution
      by diabetes severity, though pilot and periodic releases may not achieve
      balanced distribution across groups due to ongoing enrollment.

anomalies:
  - description: >
      As enrollment is ongoing, the pilot data release and periodic updates to
      data releases may not have achieved balanced distribution across groups.
    anomaly_details:
      - Early releases may exhibit unbalanced distributions across diabetes severity groups
