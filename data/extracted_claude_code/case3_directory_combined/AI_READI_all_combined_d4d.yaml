title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: |-
  The AI-READI Flagship Dataset is a harmonized, multi-modal human health dataset
  collected across three data collection sites from individuals with and without
  Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The dataset was designed with future AI/ML
  applications in mind, including a recruitment and sampling approach intended
  to approximate equal distribution across diabetes severity levels and a
  standardized data acquisition protocol spanning multiple domains: survey data,
  physical measurements, clinical assessments, imaging, wearable device data,
  and more. The overarching scientific goal is to support research into
  salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM.
  
  The dataset is distributed via the FAIRhub data portal and has both a public
  component (de-identified and non-sensitive health data, available under a
  license) and a controlled-access component (additional sensitive elements,
  accessible via a data use agreement and an approval workflow). As enrollment is
  ongoing, early/pilot releases and periodic updates may not fully achieve the
  target balanced distribution across groups. Documentation for each dataset
  version is maintained and includes clinical context, acquisition methods,
  variable summaries, domain-specific processing and formats, and additional
  resources for AI-readiness, FAIR principles, and ethical considerations.
