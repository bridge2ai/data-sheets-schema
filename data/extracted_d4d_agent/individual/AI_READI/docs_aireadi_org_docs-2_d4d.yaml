title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
description: >-
  The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and
  without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three data
  collection sites. The study design and sampling aimed to achieve approximately
  equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity categories and to
  acquire data across multiple domains (e.g., surveys, physical measurements,
  clinical data, imaging, wearable device data) to support downstream AI/ML
  analyses that are difficult with claims or EHR-only sources. Some data that
  are not considered sensitive personal health data are publicly available under
  a license agreement; access to the full dataset requires a data use
  agreement. Enrollment is ongoing; pilot and periodic releases may not be
  fully balanced across groups.

purposes:
  - response: >-
      To enable AI/Machine Learning research to better understand
      salutogenesis—the pathway from disease to health—in Type 2 Diabetes
      Mellitus (T2DM).
tasks:
  - response: >-
      Downstream AI/ML analyses across multiple clinical and real-world data
      domains (surveys, physical measurements, labs, imaging, wearable device
      data, ECG, glucose, environmental variables).
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >-
      Provide harmonized, multi-domain, prospective data suitable for AI/ML that
      are not feasible to obtain from existing sources such as claims or EHR
      data alone.
instances:
  - representation: Individual study participants across three collection sites
    instance_type: >-
      Multimodal per-participant record composed of multiple clinical and
      real-world data domains
    data_type: >-
      Survey responses, physical/clinical measurements, blood and urine lab
      results, retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, wearable device activity
      data, and environmental measures (e.g., home air quality)
    sampling_strategies:
      - strategies:
          - Stratified recruitment targeting approximately equal distribution by
            diabetes severity

  - strategies:
      - Stratified sampling targeting approximate balance across diabetes
        severity categories
    is_sample:
      - yes
    is_representative:
      - Not guaranteed; pilot release may not be balanced due to ongoing enrollment
subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - With and without T2DM
      - Diabetes severity categories (targeted approximate balance)
    distribution:
      - Targeted ~equal distribution by diabetes severity; pilot data may not be
        balanced due to ongoing enrollment
acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - Data include directly observed clinical measurements and sensor data
        (e.g., imaging, ECG, wearable devices) and participant-reported survey
        responses
    was_directly_observed: includes directly observed measurements and sensor data
    was_reported_by_subjects: includes participant-reported survey responses
collection_mechanisms:
  - description:
      - Multi-site clinical data acquisition
      - Clinical equipment and imaging systems (e.g., retinal imaging, ECG)
      - Wearable device data capture
