title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: |-
  This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.

    description: |-
      This dataset represents an expressed genome-scale CRISPRi Perturbation Cell Atlas in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) mapping transcriptional and fitness phenotypes associated with 11,739 targeted genes, as part of the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org) Functional Genomics Grand Challenge, a component of the U.S. National Institute of Health’s (NIH) Bridge2AI program. We validated these findings via phenotypic, protein-interaction, and metabolic tracing assays.
