title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: |-
  This dataset is the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).

  Data Governance & Ethics
  - Human Subjects: No
  - De-identified Samples: Yes
  - FDA Regulated: No
  - Data Governance Committee: Jillian Parker (jillianparker@health.ucsd.edu)
  - Ethical Review: Vardit Ravitsky (ravitskyv@thehastingscenter.org) and Jean-Christophe Belisle-Pipon (jean-christophe_belisle-pipon@sfu.ca)

  Completeness
  - Some datasets are under temporary pre-publication embargo
  - Protein-protein interaction (SEC-MS), protein localization (IF imaging), and CRISPRi perturb-seq data interrogate sets of proteins which incompletely overlap
  - Computed cell maps not included in this release

  Maintenance Plan
  - Dataset will be regularly updated and augmented through the end of the project in November 2026
  - Updates on a quarterly basis
  - Long term preservation in the University of Virginia Dataverse, supported by committed institutional funds

  Intended Use
  - AI-ready datasets to support research in functional genomics
  - AI model training
  - Cellular process analysis
  - Cell architectural changes and interactions in presence of specific disease processes, treatment conditions, or genetic perturbations

  Limitations
  - This is an interim release
  - Does not contain predicted cell maps, which will be added in future releases
  - The current release is most suitable for bioinformatics analysis of the individual datasets
  - Requires domain expertise for meaningful analysis

  Prohibited Uses
  - These laboratory data are not to be used in clinical decision-making or in any context involving patient care without appropriate regulatory oversight and approval

  Potential Sources of Bias
  - Data in this release was derived from commercially available de-identified human cell lines
  - Does not represent all biological variants which may be seen in the population at large
