title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: |-
  Description This dataset is the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).

  Data Governance & Ethics
  Human Subjects: No
  De-identified Samples: Yes
  FDA Regulated: No
  Data Governance Committee: Jillian Parker (jillianparker@health.ucsd.edu)
  Ethical Review: Vardit Ravitsky (ravitskyv@thehastingscenter.org) and Jean-Christophe Belisle-Pipon (jean-christophe_belisle-pipon@sfu.ca)

  Completeness
  These data are not yet in completed final form:
  Some datasets are under temporary pre-publication embargo
  Protein-protein interaction (SEC-MS), protein localization (IF imaging), and CRISPRi perturbSeq data interrogate sets of proteins which incompletely overlap
  Computed cell maps not included in this release

  Maintenance Plan
  Dataset will be regularly updated and augmented through the end of the project in November 2026
  Updates on a quarterly basis
  Long term preservation in the University of Virginia Dataverse, supported by committed institutional funds

  Intended Use
  This dataset is intended for:
  AI-ready datasets to support research in functional genomics
  AI model training
  Cellular process analysis
  Cell architectural changes and interactions in presence of specific disease processes, treatment conditions, or genetic perturbations

  Limitations
  Researchers should be aware of inherent limitations:
  This is an interim release
  Does not contain predicted cell maps, which will be added in future releases
  The current release is most suitable for bioinformatics analysis of the individual datasets
  Requires domain expertise for meaningful analysis

  Prohibited Uses
  These laboratory data are not to be used in clinical decision-making or in any context involving patient care without appropriate regulatory oversight and approval

  Potential Sources of Bias
  Users should be aware of potential biases:
  Data in this release was derived from commercially available de-identified human cell lines
  Does not represent all biological variants which may be seen in the population at large
