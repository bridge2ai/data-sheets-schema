title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: |
  A comprehensive collection of data derived from voice recordings with corresponding clinical information. Contains 12,523 recordings from 306 participants collected across five sites in North America. Participants were selected based on known conditions which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders.
