id: ai-readi-flagship-t2dm-dataset
name: AI-READI Dataset
title: "Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project"
description: >-
  A dataset consisting of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes 
  Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The dataset was designed 
  with AI/Machine Learning applications in mind, including balanced recruitment sampling 
  procedures and multi-domain data acquisition protocols.
version: "2.0.0"

purposes:
  - response: "To better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM"

tasks:
  - response: "AI/ML analyses across multiple health data domains"

instances:
  - representation: "Healthcare data across multiple domains"
    data_type: >-
      Survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data,
      blood and urine lab results, fitness activity levels, clinical measurements, retinal
      images, ECG, blood sugar levels, environmental variables
    instance_type: "Multiple data types per participant"
    sampling_strategies:
      strategies:
        - "Recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity"
      is_representative: "Distribution may not be balanced across groups in pilot/early releases as enrollment is ongoing"
