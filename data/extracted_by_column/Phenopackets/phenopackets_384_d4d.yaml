name: 384 Phenopackets
title: 384 Phenopackets Dataset
description: >
  GA4GH Phenopackets representing 384 individuals described in published case
  reports with standardized phenotypic and genetic information. The dataset
  integrates Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms with causal genetic variants
  for each individual case, following the GA4GH Phenopacket schema standard.

purposes:
  - response: >
      This dataset was created to provide standardized phenotypic and genetic
      information from published case reports using the GA4GH Phenopacket schema
      standard, enabling interoperability and computational analysis of rare disease
      cases.

tasks:
  - response: >
      Enable computational analysis of phenotype-genotype relationships using
      standardized HPO terms and genetic variant data from clinical case reports.

addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Addresses the gap in standardized, machine-readable representation of
      phenotypic and genetic data from published case reports by using the
      GA4GH Phenopacket schema standard.
