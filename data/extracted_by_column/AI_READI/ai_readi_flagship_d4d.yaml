title: "AI-READI: Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights"

abstract: |
  A comprehensive multimodal, AI-ready dataset for studying salutogenesis in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
  The AI-READI project creates and shares a flagship dataset of type 2 diabetes optimized for artificial
  intelligence and machine learning analysis. The initiative illuminates pathways from diabetes toward
  health recovery through computational methods and emphasizes ethical data sourcing and equity.

creators:
  - name: "AI-READI Consortium"

motivation: |
  To create and share a flagship ethically-sourced dataset of type 2 diabetes optimized for AI/ML
  analysis. The dataset aims to illuminate salutogenic pathways from diabetes toward health recovery
  through future AI/ML-driven computational analysis. The project develops open-source tools and
  standards for ethical, FAIR, and AI-ready datasets and shares best practices to guide future data
  generation projects.
