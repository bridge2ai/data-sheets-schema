name: AI-READI Dataset
title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
description: >
  The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and
  without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three data
  collection sites. It was designed with future AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)
  studies in mind, including recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving
  approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity, and
  a multi-domain data acquisition protocol (survey data, physical measurements,
  clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.). The goal is to
  better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM.
  Some non-sensitive data will be publicly downloadable upon agreement with a
  license defining permitted uses. The full dataset is accessible via a Data Use
  Agreement (DUA). Public data include survey data, blood and urine lab results,
  fitness activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g., monofilament and
  cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and
  environmental variables (e.g., home air quality). Controlled-access data
  include 5-digit ZIP code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past
  health records, medications, and traffic and accident reports. Enrollment is
  ongoing; pilot and periodic releases may not achieve balanced distributions
  across groups. Documentation versions correspond to dataset versions and
  include domain-level acquisition and processing details.

      Better understand salutogenesis (pathway from disease to health) in T2DM
      using a harmonized, multi-domain dataset designed for AI/ML research.
tasks:

      Enable downstream AI/ML analyses across survey, clinical, imaging,
      wearable, and environmental domains related to T2DM.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Provide a harmonized, multi-site, multi-domain dataset enabling AI/ML
      analyses not feasible with existing sources (e.g., claims or EHR alone),
      with recruitment targeting approximately equal distribution by diabetes
      severity.

sampling_strategies:
  - is_sample:
      - Yes (recruited participants across three data collection sites)
  - is_random:
      - No (targeted recruitment to balance diabetes severity)
  - source_data:
      - Participants enrolled via three data collection sites
  - is_representative:
      - Designed for approximate balance by diabetes severity; broader representativeness not claimed
  - representative_verification:
      - Balance targeted during recruitment; enrollment ongoing so pilot release may not achieve balance
  - strategies:
      - Recruitment sampling to achieve approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity
subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - With and without T2DM
      - Diabetes severity strata

      - Recruitment aimed at approximately equal distribution by diabetes severity
      - Pilot and periodic releases may not achieve full balance due to ongoing enrollment
anomalies:
  - description:
      - Ongoing enrollment means early releases may exhibit unbalanced distributions across groups.
