title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: |
  The human voice contains complex acoustic markers which have been linked to important health
  conditions including dementia, mood disorders, and cancer. When viewed as a biomarker, voice
  is a promising characteristic to measure as it is simple to collect, cost-effective, and has
  broad clinical utility. Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 provides 12,523 recordings for 306 participants
  collected across five sites in North America. Participants were selected based on known
  conditions which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological
  disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders.
