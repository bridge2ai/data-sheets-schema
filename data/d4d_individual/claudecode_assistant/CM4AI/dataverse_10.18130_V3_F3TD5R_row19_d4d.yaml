title: "Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)"
description: |
  This dataset is a revision of the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial
  Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH
  Bridge2AI program. This revision includes adding RGB immunofluorescent images,
  corrections to ro-crate metadata, and changes to naming conventions. This Beta release
  includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and
  treated and untreated MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468
  breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).

  Human Subjects: No. De-identified Samples: Yes. FDA Regulated: No.

  Known biases: Data derived from commercially available de-identified human cell lines
  and does not represent all biological variants in the population at large.
