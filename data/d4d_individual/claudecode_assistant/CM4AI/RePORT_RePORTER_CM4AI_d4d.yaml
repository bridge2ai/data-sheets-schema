title: "Bridge2AI: Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Data Generation Project"
description: |
  As part of the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program, the CM4AI data generation project
  seeks to map the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these maps toward
  the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning. The project launches
  a coordinated effort involving three complementary mapping approaches: proteomic mass
  spectrometry, cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation via CRISPR/Cas9.
