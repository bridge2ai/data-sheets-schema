description: |
  June 2025 Beta Data Release (Version 2.1) of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI),
  the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This revision includes
  adding RGB immunofluorescent images, corrections to ro-crate metadata, and changes to naming
  conventions. This release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS
  data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated
  and untreated MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in
  the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).
