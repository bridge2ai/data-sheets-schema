title: "Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence: AI-Ready Maps of Human Cell Architecture from Disease-Relevant Cell Lines"
description: |
  This article describes the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) project and its
  goals, methods, standards, current datasets, software tools, status, and future directions.
  CM4AI is the Functional Genomics Data Generation Project in the U.S. National Institute of
  Health's (NIH) Bridge2AI program. Its overarching mission is to produce ethical, AI-ready
  datasets of cell architecture, inferred from multimodal data collected for human cell lines,
  to enable transformative biomedical AI research.
