description: |
  This bioRxiv preprint describes the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) project,
  a Functional Genomics Data Generation Project in the NIH Bridge2AI program. The project produces
  ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell architecture inferred from multimodal data collected for human
  cell lines including MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs).
