  NIH Common Fund Bridge2AI program grant for the CM4AI data generation project to map
  the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these maps toward the grand challenge
  of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning. The project creates visible machine learning
  systems informed by multi-scale cell and tissue architecture.

abstract: |
  As part of the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program, the CM4AI data generation project
  seeks to map the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these maps toward
  the grand challenge of interpretable genotype-phenotype learning. In genomics and precision
  medicine, machine learning models are often "black boxes," predicting phenotypes from genotypes
  without understanding the mechanisms by which such translation occurs. To address this deficiency,
  project will launch a coordinated effort involving three complementary mapping approaches –
  proteomic mass spectrometry, cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation via CRISPR/Cas9 –
  creating a library of large-scale maps of cellular structure/function across demographic and
  disease contexts. These data will broadly stimulate research and development in "visible"
  machine learning systems informed by multi-scale cell and tissue architecture. In addition
  to data and tools, this project will implement a standards data management approach based
  on FAIR access and software principles, with deep provenance and replication packages for
  representation of cell maps and their underlying datasets; initiate a research program in
  ethical AI, especially as it relates to how maps will be used in genomic medicine and model
  interpretation; and stimulate a diverse portfolio of training opportunities in the emerging
  field of biomachine learning.

public_health_relevance: |
  Machine learning (ML) models show great promise in analyzing the human genome to make
  predictions, but the inner workings of these models are typically difficult-to-interpret
  "black boxes." To address this challenge, this Bridge2AI data generation project will
  generate a resource of matched data and tools to enable the creation of "visible" ML
  systems, which are not black boxes but are built directly on knowledge maps of cell
  and tissue architecture.
