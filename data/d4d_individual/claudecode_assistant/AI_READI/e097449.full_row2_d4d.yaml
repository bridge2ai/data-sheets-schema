title: "Cross-sectional design and protocol for Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI)"
description: |
  AI-READI is a cross-sectional study whose target enrollment is 4000 people aged 40 and older,
  triple-balanced by self-reported race/ethnicity (Asian, black, Hispanic, white), T2DM severity
  (no diabetes, pre-diabetes, lifestyle-controlled, oral medications, insulin-controlled) and
  biological sex (male, female). Data are collected in a multivariable protocol containing over
  10 domains across three study sites: Birmingham, Alabama; San Diego, California; and Seattle, Washington.
