description: |
  The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project
  is one of the data generation projects in the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program. The project
  seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of AI/ML research
  to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways
  to return to health.
