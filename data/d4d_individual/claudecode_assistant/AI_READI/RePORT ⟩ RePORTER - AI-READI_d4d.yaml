title: Bridge2AI - Salutogenesis Data Generation
description: >
  The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI)
  project is one of the data generation projects in the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program.
  The project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations
  of AI/ML research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including
  salutogenic pathways to return to health. Target enrollment is 4,000+ people with cross-sectional
  dataset and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US, balanced for diabetes
  disease stage.
