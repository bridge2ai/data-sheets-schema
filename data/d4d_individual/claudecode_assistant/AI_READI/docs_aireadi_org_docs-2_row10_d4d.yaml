  Documentation for the AI-READI dataset called Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the
  AI-READI Project. The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and
  without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The
  composition was designed with future AI/ML studies in mind, including balanced recruitment
  across diabetes severity and multi-domain data acquisition.
