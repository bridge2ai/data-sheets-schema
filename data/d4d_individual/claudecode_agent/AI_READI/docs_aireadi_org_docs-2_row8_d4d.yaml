title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: 'The AI-READI is a dataset consisting of data collected from individuals
  with and without Type 2

  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The composition
  of the

  dataset was designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind. This
  included

  recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution
  of participants

  across diabetes severity, as well as the design of a data acquisition protocol across
  multiple

  domains (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable
  device data,

  etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses.
