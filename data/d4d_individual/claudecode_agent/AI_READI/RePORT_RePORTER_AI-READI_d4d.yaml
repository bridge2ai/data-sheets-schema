title: 'Bridge2AI: Salutogenesis Data Generation (AI-READI)'
description: 'The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes
  Insights (AI-READI)

  project is one of the data generation projects in the NIH Common Fund''s Bridge2AI
  program.

  The project seeks to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future
  generations

  of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical
  insights into

  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways to return to health.
  The team

  will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset of 4,000+ people and longitudinal
  data from 10%

  of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be balanced for diabetes
  disease stage.

  The long-term objective is to develop a foundational dataset in diabetes, agnostic
  to existing

  classification criteria, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM
  development

  and reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis).
