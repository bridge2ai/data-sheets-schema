  Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI)
description: 'AI-READI is a cross-sectional study whose target enrollment is 4000
  people aged 40 and older,

  triple-balanced by self-reported race/ethnicity (Asian, black, Hispanic, white),
  T2DM severity

  (no diabetes, pre-diabetes and lifestyle-controlled diabetes, diabetes treated with
  oral

  medications or non-insulin injections, and insulin-controlled diabetes) and biological
  sex

  (male, female). Data are collected in a multivariable protocol containing over 10
  domains,

  including vitals, retinal imaging, electrocardiogram, cognitive function, continuous
  glucose

  monitoring, physical activity, home air quality, blood and urine collection for
  laboratory

  testing and psychosocial variables including social determinants of health.
