title: Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights
description: >
  The Artificial Intelligence Ready and Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project
  is one of the data generation projects in the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program. The project seeks
  to create a flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future generations of artificial intelligence/machine
  learning (AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including
  salutogenic pathways to return to health. The team of investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional
  dataset of 4,000+ people and longitudinal data from 10% of the study cohort across the US. The study cohort
  will be balanced for diabetes disease stage. Data collection will be specifically designed to permit downstream
  pseudotime manifold analysis, an approach used to predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning from
  complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent T2DM).
  The long-term objective for this project is to develop a foundational dataset in diabetes, agnostic to existing
  classification criteria, which can be used to reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal
  towards health (i.e., salutogenesis).

# Motivation
purposes:
  - description: >
      Better understand salutogenic pathways to return to health in type 2 diabetes mellitus
      using ethically-sourced multimodal datasets designed for AI/ML research.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Enable pseudotime manifold analysis to predict disease trajectories by learning from
      complex, multimodal data from participants with differing disease severity.
  - description: >
      Reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and reversal towards health.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Address the lack of well-designed, high quality, and large multimodal datasets needed
      to understand and affect the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as T2DM.

# Composition
instances:
  - description: >
      Individual participants with different severities of type 2 diabetes mellitus (normal
      to insulin-dependent T2DM), with multimodal data including molecular, physiological,
      pathological, and clinical measurements at various stages of illness.

# Collection
collection_mechanisms:
  - description: >
      Cross-sectional data collection from 4,000+ participants and longitudinal data from
      10% of the study cohort across multiple US sites. Study cohort balanced for diabetes
      disease stage. Data collection designed specifically for downstream pseudotime manifold
      analysis.

sampling_strategies:
  - description: >
      Targeted recruitment to achieve balanced representation across diabetes disease stages,
      from normal to insulin-dependent T2DM.

# Uses
intended_uses:
  - description: >
      AI/ML research to provide critical insights into type 2 diabetes mellitus, including
