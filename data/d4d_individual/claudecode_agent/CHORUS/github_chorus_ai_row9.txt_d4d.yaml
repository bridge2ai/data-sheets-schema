title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  The CHoRUS Network develops diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready datasets
  to address the challenge of improving recovery from acute illness. This collaboration spans
  20 academic centers, of which 14 contribute as Data Acquisition centers. The project employs
  unified standards to harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data, with
  patient-focused efforts to manage privacy and bias while accounting for Social Determinants
  of Health.

  - description: >
      Develop skills and workforce for next generation of diverse academic and community AI
      scientists.

# Composition
instances:
  - description: >
      Multi-modal clinical data including EHR records, physiological waveforms, medical imaging,
      and clinical text from 20 academic centers with 14 Data Acquisition centers.

# Collection
acquisition_methods:
  - description: >
      Data collected from 20 academic medical centers using standard operating protocols (SOPs)
      documented in the Chorus_SOP repository. Sites extract and contribute clinical data
      following validated workflows.
    was_directly_observed: true

data_collectors:
  - description: >
      Data Site Managers at 14 Data Acquisition centers across the CHoRUS consortium follow
      standardized extraction and contribution procedures.

# Distribution
distribution_formats:
  - description: >
      Software and tooling provided through GitHub repositories to interact with and extract
      insight from clinical data in diverse formats. Validated semantic mappings connect clinical
      data in various source formats to international standards.
