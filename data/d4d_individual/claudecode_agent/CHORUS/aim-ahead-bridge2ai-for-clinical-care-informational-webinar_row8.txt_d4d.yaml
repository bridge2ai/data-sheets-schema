title: CHoRUS - Bridge2AI for Clinical Care Multicenter Multimodal Dataset
description: >
  The CHoRUS Dataset is a multicenter, multimodal, and high-resolution clinical care dataset
  developed as part of the Bridge2AI program. As of November 2024, it covers 14 different
  hospitals with 23,400 unique admissions. The dataset includes retrospective data collection
  with controlled access, incorporating OMOP-standardized data and telemetry stored in an enclave,
  with additional data types including clinical notes, imaging, and EEG in various stages of
  processing and de-identification.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - description: >
      Develop AI-ready clinical care datasets for the AIM-AHEAD Bridge2AI Training Program to
      increase access to Bridge2AI AI/ML datasets, especially for underrepresented trainees.
  - description: >
      Enable data-driven research addressing health disparities through training and mentorship
      on AI/ML and big data analysis.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Provide training datasets for AI/ML applications in clinical care, supporting diverse,
      multi-modal analysis of patient data from a broad cohort.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Expand AI/ML proficiency in communities historically underrepresented in biomedical research.
  - description: >
      Equip trainees to work with diverse, multi-modal datasets for impactful AI/ML research
      addressing health disparities.

# Composition
instances:
  - description: >
      As of November 2024, the dataset includes 23,400 unique hospital admissions from 14 different
      hospitals. Data types include demographics, medication administration, procedures, nursing
      flowsheets, diagnoses, clinical notes, imaging, and waveform telemetry.

# Collection
acquisition_methods:
  - description: >
      Retrospective data collection from 14 hospitals participating in the CHoRUS consortium.
      Data collected includes OMOP-standardized clinical data and waveform telemetry from bedside
      monitors.
