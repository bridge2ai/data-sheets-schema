title: Patient-Focused Collaborative Hospital Repository Uniting Standards (CHoRUS) for Equitable AI
description: >
  The CHoRUS Network develops the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready clinical dataset
  to answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness. This collaboration spans 20 academic
  centers, of which 14 contribute as Data Acquisition centers, harmonizing multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging,
  and text data using unified standards.

# Motivation
purposes:
  - description: >
      To develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically sourced, AI-ready data set to answer
      the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute illness.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Training AI/ML models for clinical care and acute illness recovery using multi-modal clinical data.
  - description: >
      Developing skills and workforce for next generation of diverse academic and community AI scientists.
  - description: >
      Visualization and annotation of clinical data with prediction targets.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Lack of diverse, high-resolution clinical datasets for AI/ML research that account for Social
      Determinants of Health.
  - description: >
      Need for ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy and bias in clinical AI datasets.
