      To enable data-driven research addressing health disparities using diverse, multi-modal datasets.

tasks:
  - description: >
      Training AI/ML models for clinical applications using multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data.
  - description: >
      Training programs on AI/ML and big data analysis for clinical care through AIM-AHEAD Bridge2AI partnership.
  - description: >
      Developing use cases for Bridge2AI Data Topics focused on improving recovery from acute illness.

addressing_gaps:
  - description: >
      Limited access to diverse, multi-modal clinical datasets for AI/ML research.
  - description: >
      Need for AI/ML training focused on health disparities and underrepresented communities.
