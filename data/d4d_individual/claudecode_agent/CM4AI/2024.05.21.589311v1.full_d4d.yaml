title: "Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence: AI-Ready Maps of Human Cell Architecture from Disease-Relevant Cell Lines"
description: |
  This article describes the Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) project and its goals, methods,
  standards, current datasets, software tools, status, and future directions. CM4AI is the Functional
  Genomics Data Generation Project in the U.S. National Institute of Health's (NIH) Bridge2AI program.
  Its overarching mission is to produce ethical, AI-ready datasets of cell architecture, inferred from
  multimodal data collected for human cell lines, to enable transformative biomedical AI research.

  CM4AI delivers machine-readable hierarchical maps of cell architecture as AI-Ready data produced from
  multimodal interrogation of 100 chromatin modifiers and 100 metabolic enzymes involved in cancer,
  neuropsychiatric, and cardiac disorders in disease-relevant cell lines.
