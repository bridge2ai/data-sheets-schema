title: "Bridge2AI: Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) Data Generation Project"
description: |
  As part of the NIH Common Fund's Bridge2AI program, the CM4AI data generation project seeks to map
  the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these maps toward the grand challenge of
  interpretable genotype-phenotype learning. The project launches a coordinated effort involving three
  complementary mapping approaches - proteomic mass spectrometry, cellular imaging, and genetic
  perturbation via CRISPR/Cas9 - creating a library of large-scale maps of cellular structure/function
  across demographic and disease contexts.
