title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: |
  This dataset is a revision of the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This revision includes adding RGB immunofluorescent images, corrections to ro-crate metadata, and changes to naming conventions.

  This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).

  - Mass Spectrometry Data (Human iPSCs): MassIVE Repository
  - Mass Spectrometry Data (Human Cancer Cells): MassIVE Repository

  Data Governance & Ethics:
  - Human Subjects: No
  - De-identified Samples: Yes
  - FDA Regulated: No
  - Data Governance Committee: Jillian Parker (jillianparker@health.ucsd.edu)
  - Ethical Review: Vardit Ravitsky (ravitskyv@thehastingscenter.org) and Jean-Christophe Belisle-Pipon (jean-christophe_belisle-pipon@sfu.ca)

  Completeness: These data are not yet in completed final form. Some datasets are under temporary pre-publication embargo. Protein-protein interaction (SEC-MS), protein localization (IF imaging), and CRISPRi perturbSeq data interrogate sets of proteins which incompletely overlap. Computed cell maps not included in this release.

  Maintenance Plan: Dataset will be regularly updated and augmented through the end of the project in November 2026 on a quarterly basis. Long term preservation in the University of Virginia Dataverse, supported by committed institutional funds.

  Limitations: This is an interim release. Does not contain predicted cell maps, which will be added in future releases. The current release is most suitable for bioinformatics analysis of the individual datasets. Requires domain expertise for meaningful analysis.

  Prohibited Uses: These laboratory data are not to be used in clinical decision-making or in any context involving patient care without appropriate regulatory oversight and approval.

  Potential Sources of Bias: Data in this release was derived from commercially available de-identified human cell lines and does not represent all biological variants which may be seen in the population at large.
