title: "Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)"
version: "2.1"
description: |
  This dataset is a revision of the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
  (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This revision
  includes adding RGB immunofluorescent images, corrections to ro-crate metadata, and changes to naming
  conventions.

  This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated
  MDA-MB468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and
  absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).
