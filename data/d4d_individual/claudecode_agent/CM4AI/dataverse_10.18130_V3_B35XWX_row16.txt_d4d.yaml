title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: |
  This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).

  CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.

motivation_why_created:
  motivation_for_creation: |
    This dataset was created to provide AI-ready, ethically sourced datasets of cell architecture from multimodal data to enable transformative biomedical AI research as part of the NIH Bridge2AI program. The March 2025 Beta release provides comprehensive data on protein perturbations, protein-protein interactions, and spatial protein localization to support functional genomics research.

  primary_use: |
    The dataset is intended for AI-ready datasets to support research in functional genomics, AI model training, cellular process analysis, and understanding cell architectural changes and interactions in the presence of specific disease processes, treatment conditions, or genetic perturbations.

  other_tasks: null

  gap_in_knowledge: null

composition_what_data:
  instance_type: |
    The dataset contains:
    1. CRISPRi perturbation cell atlas data (JSON) mapping transcriptional and fitness phenotypes for 11,739 targeted genes
    2. Raw RNA sequencing data from CRISPR perturbation screens (JSON)
    3. Immunofluorescence subcellular images (ZIP archives) showing protein localization for 563 proteins under three conditions (untreated, paclitaxel, vorinostat)
    4. Size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) data on iPSCs (JSON)
    5. RO-Crate metadata files with provenance information

  instance_count: |
    - 302 total downloads as of publication
    - 11,739 targeted genes in perturbation atlas
    - 563 proteins with spatial localization data
    - 6 data files total (3 image archives, 3 metadata/data files)

  instance_structure: |
    Data is packaged in RO-Crate format with provenance graphs and rich metadata. Image datasets are organized by treatment condition (untreated, paclitaxel, vorinostat). Each image shows spatial localization with DAPI (nuclei, blue), calreticulin (ER, yellow), tubulin (microtubules, red), and protein of interest (green) channels.

  data_splits: null

  de_identification_methods: |
    The data is derived from established, de-identified cell lines (MDA-MB-468 breast cancer and KOLF2.1J induced pluripotent stem cells) that cannot be matched to individual human subjects.

  sensitive_information_risk: |
    No sensitive information risk as data is from de-identified cell lines, not human subjects.

  confidential_items: null

  individual_instances: null

  subpopulation_description: |
    Two cell line systems:
    1. MDA-MB-468 triple negative breast cancer cells under three treatment conditions (untreated, paclitaxel, vorinostat)
    2. KOLF2.1J iPSCs in undifferentiated state and differentiated into NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes

  missing_info: null

  relationship_between_instances: |
    Instances are related through:
    1. Common cell lines (MDA-MB-468, KOLF2.1J)
    2. Treatment conditions (untreated, paclitaxel, vorinostat)
    3. Protein targets studied across multiple modalities (perturbation, localization, interactions)
    4. Provenance relationships documented in RO-Crate metadata

  other_information: null

  recommended_data_splits: null

  error_sources: null

collection_how_collected:
  collection_method: |
    Data was collected using three complementary approaches:
    1. CRISPRi perturbation screens using 10x Genomics 3'HT kit for single-cell RNA sequencing
    2. Immunofluorescence-based staining (ICC-IF) and confocal microscopy using Human Protein Atlas antibodies
    3. Size exclusion chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) for protein complex mapping

  sampling_strategy: |
    Focused on chromatin regulators and proteins of interest across disease-relevant cell lines under perturbed and unperturbed conditions.
