**Instructions:**
1. Analyze the content below and extract all available dataset metadata
2. Format the output as valid YAML following the D4D schema structure
3. Include these key sections if information is available:
   - id, name, title, description
   - creators (with names, affiliations, roles)
   - purposes and intended uses
   - instances (data types, counts, representations)
   - collection_mechanisms and timeframes
   - preprocessing_strategies and cleaning
   - distribution_formats and access
   - ethical_reviews and consent
   - license_and_use_terms
   - maintainers and funding

**D4D Schema Reference:**
```yaml
# Key D4D fields (use as template):
