Abstract Text

Our group aims to integrate the use of voice as biomarker

of health in clinical care by generating a substantial multi-
institutional, ethically sourced, and diverse voice database
linked to multimodal health biomarkers to fuel voice AI
research and build predictive models to assist in

screening, diagnosis, and treatment of a broad range of
diseases. Data collection will be made possible by
software through a smartphone application linked to
electronic health records (EHR) and other health

biomarkers such as radiomics, and genomics, and

supported by federated learning technology to protect

data privacy. Based on the existing literature and ongoing

research in different fields of voice research, our group

has identified 5 disease categories for which voice

changes have been associated to specific diseases and

around which we aim to center the data acquisition

efforts: 1. Vocal Pathologies (Laryngeal cancers, Vocal

fold paralysis, Benign laryngeal lesions) 2. Neurological

and Neurodegenerative Disorders (Alzheimer’s,

Parkinson’s, Stroke, ALS) 3. Mood and Psychiatric

Disorders (Depression, Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorders)

4. Respiratory disorders (Pneumonia, COPD, Heart Failure,

OSA) 5. Pediatric diseases (Autism, Speech Delay)

Specific Aim #1: Data Acquisition Module: - To build a
multi-modal, multi-institutional, large scale, diverse and
ethically sourced human voice database linked to other
biomarkers of health that is AI/ML friendly to fuel voice AI
research Specific Aim #2: Standard Module: - To introduce
the field of acoustic biomarkers by developing new

standards of acoustic and voice data collection and
analysis for voice AI research. Specific Aim #3: Tool
Development and optimization - To develop a software
and cloud infrastructure for automated voice data
collection through a smartphone application that allows
non-invasive, user-friendly, high quality voice data
collection while minimizing human manipulation. This will
include integrated acoustic amplifiers and acoustic

quality standardization. - To implement Federated
Learning technology to allow analysis of multi-
institutional data while minimizing data sharing and
preserving patient privacy Specific Aim #4: Ethics Module
- To integrate existing scholarship, tools, and guidance
with development of new standard and normative insights
for identifying, anticipating, addressing, and providing
guidance on ethical and trustworthy issues from voice
data generation and AI/ML research and development to

clinical adoption and downstream health decisions and
outcomes. - To develop new guidelines for consenting to
voice data collection, voice data sharing and utilization in

the context of voice AI technology Specific Aim # 5:

Teaming Module: - To build bridges between the medical

voice research world, the acoustic engineers, and the

AI/ML world to promote the integration of tangible clinical

application for Voice AI algorithms Specific Aim #6: Skills

and Workforce Development Module - To develop a

unique curriculum on voice biomarkers of health and the

development, validation, and implementation for AI

models that are FAIR and CARE - To create a community

of voice AI researchers, especially those from

underserved communities, and foster collaborations to

promote application of ML for Voice Research - To

engage a broad range of learners with competency

assessment and mentorship

Public Health Relevance Statement

As Voice is increasingly being recognized as a biomarker
of health by the tech world and Voice AI is gaining
attention from multi-nationals such as Google, Amazon,
Mozilla and Apple amongst others, many important
issues related to patient privacy protection, ethical and
fair representation of population, and clinical accuracy are

arising. As a multidisciplinary group of academic experts,
we aim to influence and guide the world of Voice AI by
ensuring patient protection through ethical and fairness
principles and create safe, innovative infrastructures to
disseminate ethically sourced data for the future
generations of Voice AI researchers.
