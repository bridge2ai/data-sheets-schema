As part of the NIH Common Fund’s Bridge2AI program,
the CM4AI data generation project seeks to map the

spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and use these
maps toward the grand challenge of interpretable
genotype-phenotype learning. In genomics and precision
medicine, machine learning models are often "black
boxes," predicting phenotypes from genotypes without

understanding the mechanisms by which such translation
occurs. To address this deficiency, project will launch a
coordinated effort involving three complementary
mapping approaches – proteomic mass spectrometry,

cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation via
CRISPR/Cas9 – creating a library of large-scale maps ofPrivacy  -  Terms

cellular structure/function across demographic and

disease contexts. These data will broadly stimulate

research and development in "visible" machine learning

systems informed by multi-scale cell and tissue

architecture. In addition to data and tools, this project will

implement a standards data management approach

based on FAIR access and software principles, with deep

provenance and replication packages for representation

of cell maps and their underlying datasets; initiate a

research program in ethical AI, especially as it relates to

how maps will be used in genomic medicine and model

interpretation; and stimulate a diverse portfolio of training

opportunities in the emerging field of biomachine

learning.

Public Health Relevance Statement

Machine learning (ML) models show great promise in
analyzing the human genome to make predictions, but the

inner workings of these models are typically difficult-to-
interpret "black boxes." To address this challenge, this
Bridge2AI data generation project will generate a resource
of matched data and tools to enable the creation of
"visible" ML systems, which are not black boxes but are
built directly on knowledge maps of cell and tissue
architecture.
