CHoRUS for Equitable AI

The goal of the CHoRUS Network is to develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically

sourced, AI-ready data set to answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute

illness.

This collaboration spans 20 academic centers, of which 14 will contribute as Data

Acquisition centers.

Patient-focused efforts will determine the ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy

and bias, while accounting for Social Determinants of Health.

Unified standards will harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data.

A visualization and annotation environment will label data with targets important for

prediction.

A comprehensive set of approaches will develop the skills and workforce for a next

generation of diverse academic and community AI scientists.

Federated access will enable sampling methods to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort.

Collaborating with Bridge2AI and 3 other data generation projects, the CHoRUS Network will

help us cross the Bridge2AI network together.

Get Started

The CHoRUS GitHub organization houses active repositories that provide:

1. Software and tooling to interact with and extract insight from clinical data in diverse

formats

2. Validated semantic mappings for connecting clinical data in various source formats to

international standards

3. Standard operating protocols (SOPs) to instruct data contributing sites about best

practices for curating and delivering interoperable datasets

4. Project management overviews to help track data delivery statuses and complex task

dependencies within CHoRUS

We've defined different groups of anticipated users of this GitHub in the sections below, and

direct those users to appropriate locations within the chorus-ai repository space.

Data Site Managers

The starting reference for data managers at data contributing sites is the Chorus_SOP page.

Here, you will find an interactive workflow diagram describing the step-by-step process for

extracting and contributing clinical data to CHoRUS, with dynamic links to various SOP

documents that have undergone an internal validation and review process within the

Chorus_SOP repository.

CHoRUS for Equitable AI

The workflow diagram also includes links to a wealth of recordings and documentation

compiled by the various sub-teams (Standards, Data Acquisition, and Tooling) within the

CHoRUS DGP.

If you run into any issues in the creation or submission of your data extract, please feel free
to post them in the relevant context-specific discussion location:

Standards Discussions

Data Acquisition Discussions

Clinical Collaborators

(back to top)

Clinical expertise is invaluable to semantic mapping and validation within CHoRUS. We have

established a chorus-mapping repository with documentation and pooled tabular mappings

along with an associated clinical validation SOP for contributing to mapping efforts.

If you're interested in getting involved in downstream analytics on the mapped and
assembled dataset, please feel free to reach out using the contact details below

(back to top)

Project Managers

We've established two different modes of project management within the chorus-ai
organization:

1. Task tracking among CHoRUS members and across teams

2. Status tracking of data contributing sites to identify and resolve any blocking issues

Task Tracking

We are aggregating issues across various repositories into an overall task management

project. In this GitHub project, we assign users to tasks, create and track anticipated

delivery dates, and highlight dependencies between tasks and users. Several per-repo
projects are also active, but we are in the process of phasing those projects out and

migrating their contents to this central project space.

Status Tracking

We have asked data contributing sites to provide regular status updates with regard to their

progress in creating and curating a CHoRUS-specific clinical data extract. Sites can submit

updates either using the GitHub interface directly, or by submitting a Google Form (please

reach out to get a link to the form if you'd like to submit an update for your site). We've

created a GoogleScript that is triggered on each Google Form submission and makes calls
to the GitHub API to update status and issue information appropriately. These site statuses

end up in either the Standards Project or the Data Acquisition Project.

Software Developers

We have software contributors within CHoRUS who have a broad range of expertise, and

who have produced powerful open-source tooling for transforming and interacting with

clinical data. We have created a web guide for both contributors and users of the CHoRUS

software packages that compiles documentation in the chorus-developer repository.

You can check the versions, maintainers, and other metadata about CHoRUS packages

using our package status page.

About

CHoRUS for Equitable AI

The goal of the CHoRUS Network is to develop the most diverse, high-resolution, ethically

sourced, AI-ready data set to answer the grand challenge of improving recovery from acute

illness.

This collaboration spans 20 academic centers, of which 14 will contribute as Data

Acquisition centers.

Patient-focused efforts will determine the ethical and legal approaches to manage privacy

and bias, while accounting for Social Determinants of Health.

Unified standards will harmonize multi-modal EHR, waveform, imaging, and text data.

A visualization and annotation environment will label data with targets important for

prediction.

A comprehensive set of approaches will develop the skills and workforce for a next

generation of diverse academic and community AI scientists.

Federated access will enable sampling methods to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort.

Collaborating with Bridge2AI and 3 other data generation projects, the CHoRUS Network will

help us cross the Bridge2AI network together.

Get Started

The CHoRUS GitHub organization houses active repositories that provide:

1. Software and tooling to interact with and extract insight from clinical data in diverse

formats

2. Validated semantic mappings for connecting clinical data in various source formats to

international standards

3. Standard operating protocols (SOPs) to instruct data contributing sites about best

practices for curating and delivering interoperable datasets

4. Project management overviews to help track data delivery statuses and complex task

dependencies within CHoRUS

We've defined different groups of anticipated users of this GitHub in the sections below, and

direct those users to appropriate locations within the chorus-ai repository space.

Data Site Managers

The starting reference for data managers at data contributing sites is the Chorus_SOP page.

Here, you will find an interactive workflow diagram describing the step-by-step process for

extracting and contributing clinical data to CHoRUS, with dynamic links to various SOP

documents that have undergone an internal validation and review process within the

Chorus_SOP repository.

CHoRUS for Equitable AI

The workflow diagram also includes links to a wealth of recordings and documentation

compiled by the various sub-teams (Standards, Data Acquisition, and Tooling) within the

CHoRUS DGP.

If you run into any issues in the creation or submission of your data extract, please feel free
to post them in the relevant context-specific discussion location:

Standards Discussions

Data Acquisition Discussions

Clinical Collaborators

(back to top)

Clinical expertise is invaluable to semantic mapping and validation within CHoRUS. We have

established a chorus-mapping repository with documentation and pooled tabular mappings

along with an associated clinical validation SOP for contributing to mapping efforts.

If you're interested in getting involved in downstream analytics on the mapped and
assembled dataset, please feel free to reach out using the contact details below

(back to top)

Project Managers

We've established two different modes of project management within the chorus-ai
organization:

1. Task tracking among CHoRUS members and across teams

2. Status tracking of data contributing sites to identify and resolve any blocking issues

Task Tracking

We are aggregating issues across various repositories into an overall task management

project. In this GitHub project, we assign users to tasks, create and track anticipated

delivery dates, and highlight dependencies between tasks and users. Several per-repo
projects are also active, but we are in the process of phasing those projects out and

migrating their contents to this central project space.

Status Tracking

We have asked data contributing sites to provide regular status updates with regard to their

progress in creating and curating a CHoRUS-specific clinical data extract. Sites can submit

updates either using the GitHub interface directly, or by submitting a Google Form (please

reach out to get a link to the form if you'd like to submit an update for your site). We've

created a GoogleScript that is triggered on each Google Form submission and makes calls
to the GitHub API to update status and issue information appropriately. These site statuses

end up in either the Standards Project or the Data Acquisition Project.

Software Developers

We have software contributors within CHoRUS who have a broad range of expertise, and

who have produced powerful open-source tooling for transforming and interacting with

clinical data. We have created a web guide for both contributors and users of the CHoRUS

software packages that compiles documentation in the chorus-developer repository.

You can check the versions, maintainers, and other metadata about CHoRUS packages

using our package status page.
