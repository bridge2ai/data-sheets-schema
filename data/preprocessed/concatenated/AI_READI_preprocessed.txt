Abstract Text

Abstract Text The Artificial Intelligence Ready and
Exploratory Atlas for Diabetes Insights (AI-READI) project
is one of the data generation projects in the NIH Common

Fund’s Bridge2AI program. The project seeks to create a
flagship ethically-sourced dataset to enable future
generations of artificial intelligence/machine learning
(AI/ML) research to provide critical insights into type 2
diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including salutogenic pathways

to return to health. The ability to understand and affect
the course of complex, multi-organ diseases such as
T2DM has been limited by a lack of well-designed, high
quality, and large multimodal datasets. The team of

investigators will aim to collect a cross-sectional dataset
of 4,000+ people and longitudinal data from 10% of thePrivacy  -  Terms

study cohort across the US. The study cohort will be

balanced for diabetes disease stage. Data collection will

be specifically designed to permit downstream

pseudotime manifold analysis, an approach used to

predict disease trajectories by collecting and learning

from complex, multimodal data from participants with

differing disease severity (normal to insulin-dependent

T2DM). The long-term objective for this project is to

develop a foundational dataset in diabetes, agnostic to

existing classification criteria, which can be used to

reconstruct a temporal atlas of T2DM development and

reversal towards health (i.e., salutogenesis). Six cross-

disciplinary project modules involving teams located

across eight institutions will work together to develop this

flagship dataset. All data will be optimized for
downstream AI/ML research and made publicly available.
. The AI-READI project will also engage in a tribal
consultation to address barriers and facilitators of
participation with the goal of collecting similar data within
a Native American cohort in an ethical and respectful

manner. Specific aims include 1) Collect and share the
dataset for AI/ML research according to the Findable,
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) data principles,
2) Create a model for developing large scalable datasets,
and 3) Increase access to and quality of AI/ML research
by recruiting and training personnel.

Public Health Relevance Statement

Public Health Relevance Statement Recent advances in
artificial intelligence (AI) research are poised to provide
breakthrough discoveries, but have been limited by the
lack of large, well-characterized comprehensive datasets
that capture molecular, physiological, pathological, and
clinical at various stages of illness. To address these
challenges, the AI-READI team of investigators will

generate an ethically-sourced and unique dataset with
many types of data collected from patients with different
severities of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), which will
enable key discoveries about the trajectory of this disease

and how improvements to health (i.e., salutogenesis) can

be promoted over time. The project will train future

scientists in AI-based research and establish best

practices for the generation of future datasets that are

ethically sourced and accessible for responsible and

scientifically valid use by the greater research community.

This is the documentation for the AI-READI dataset called Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project. It is intended to complement the information provided on the dataset landing page on the FAIRhub data portal. It is highly suggested to read this documentation first before accessing the dataset.
About the AI-READI datasetâ
The AI-READI is a dataset consisting of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across 3 data collection sites. The composition of the dataset was designed with future studies using AI/Machine Learning in mind. This included recruitment sampling procedures aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes severity, as well as the design of a data acquisition protocol across multiple domains (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that may not be feasible with existing data sources such as claims or electronic health records data.
The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. Some data that are not considered to be sensitive personal health data will be available to the public for download upon agreement with a license that defines how the data can be used. The full dataset will be accessible by entering into a data use agreement. The public dataset will include survey data, blood and urine lab results, fitness activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g. monofilament and cognitive function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and environmental variables such as home air quality. The data held under controlled access include 5-digit zip code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past health records, medications, and traffic and accident reports. As enrollment is ongoing, the pilot data release and periodic updates to data releases may not have achieved balanced distribution across groups.

ABSTRACT
Introduction  Artificial Intelligence Ready and Equitable 
for Diabetes Insights (AI- READI) is a data collection 
project on type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to facilitate 
the widespread use of artificial intelligence and machine 
learning (AI/ML) approaches to study salutogenesis 
(transitioning from T2DM to health resilience). The 
fundamental rationale for promoting health resilience in 
T2DM stems from its high prevalence of 10.5% of the 
world’s adult population and its contribution to many 
adverse health events.
Methods  AI- READI is a cross- sectional study whose 
target enrollment is 4000 people aged 40 and older, triple- 
balanced by self- reported race/ethnicity (Asian, black, 
Hispanic, white), T2DM (no diabetes, pre- diabetes and 
lifestyle- controlled diabetes, diabetes treated with oral 
medications or non- insulin injections and insulin- controlled 
diabetes) and biological sex (male, female) ( Clinicaltrials. org 
approval number STUDY00016228). Data are collected in a 
multivariable protocol containing over 10 domains, including 
vitals, retinal imaging, electrocardiogram, cognitive function, 
continuous glucose monitoring, physical activity, home air 
quality, blood and urine collection for laboratory testing and 
psychosocial variables including social determinants of 
health. There are three study sites: Birmingham, Alabama; 
San Diego, California; and Seattle, Washington.
Ethics and dissemination  AI- READI aims to establish 
standards, best practices and guidelines for collection, 
preparation and sharing of the data for the purposes of 
AI/ML, including guidance from bioethicists. Following 
Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles, 
AI- READI can be viewed as a model for future efforts 
to develop other medical/health data sets targeted 
for AI/ML. AI- READI opens the door for novel insights 
in understanding T2DM salutogenesis. The AI- READI 
Consortium are disseminating the principles and processes 
of designing and implementing the AI- READI data set 
through publications. Those who download and use AI- 
READI data are encouraged to publish their results in the 
scientific literature.

INTRODUCTION
Artificial  Intelligence  Ready  and  Equitable 
for  Diabetes  Insights  (AI- READI)1  is  one  of 

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ The  targeted  sample  size  of  4000  persons  is  the 
largest publicly accessible data set currently avail-
able  containing  many  multidomain  variables  rele-
vant to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

 ⇒ The  sample  is  designed  to  be  approximately  bal-
anced  with  respect  to  sex  and  race/ethnicities 
(Asians,  blacks,  Hispanics  and  whites),  a  demo-
graphic improvement over many previous epidemi-
ological studies and clinical trials on T2DM.

 ⇒ The study population is designed to be balanced in 
T2DM severity groups of no diabetes, pre- diabetes, 
non- insulin controlled and insulin controlled, to fa-
cilitate artificial intelligence/machine learning model 
developments.

 ⇒ The study design process enacted ethical and equi-
table data collection and management practices as 
well as data sharing with adherence to the Findable, 
Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable principles.
 ⇒ A limitation of our biorepository is that there are a 
finite  number  of  samples  to  share  with  scientists 
interested  in  using  them  in  research.  Procedures 
for  reviewing  and  prioritising  written  requests  will 
be developed before the biorepository is complete.

the multifactorial and multisystemic nature of T2DM. The 
fundamental  rationale  for  promoting  health  resilience 
in T2DM stems from its high prevalence of 10.5% of the 
world’s adult population.3 Persons with T2DM are at risk 
for  many  types  of  adverse  health  consequences  such  as 
stroke, kidney disease, heart disease, vision impairment, 
cognitive  decline,  peripheral  neuropathy  and  physical 
inactivity.4 Social determinants of health weigh heavily in 
threatening medical status in T2DM,5 including reduced 
access to healthcare, decline in treatment adherence and 
challenges  in  seeking  follow- up  preventative  care.6  The 
prevalence of T2DM is higher in certain racial and ethnic 
populations,7  8  and  the  deleterious  consequences  are 
exacerbated in these populations.9 10

There  are  certain  unique  features  of  AI- READI’s 
design  which  make  it  ideally  suited  for  the  use  of  AI/
ML  analytic  approaches,  which  opens  the  door  for  crit-
ical novel insights into understanding salutogenesis. First, 
the AI- READI team, a multidisciplinary group of investi-
gators,  including  clinicians,  data  scientists,  vision  scien-
tists,  computer  scientists,  organisational  scientists  and 
ethicists,  designed  the  protocol  such  that  it  is  agnostic 
to hypotheses. Rather, the team assembled a data collec-
tion protocol composed of assessments from many health 
domains  that  are  likely  impacted  by  T2DM.  Second,  to 
address inherent limitations of many existing large data 
sets  for  AI/ML  training,  the  cohort  is  designed  to  be 
balanced in race/ethnicity, T2DM severity and biological 
sex. Third, the data set is large, with a target sample size 
of 4000 persons from three geographical regions in the 
USA. Fourth, AI- READI places special emphasis on estab-
lishing standards, best practices and guidelines for collec-
tion, preparation and sharing of the data that can be used 
for future efforts to develop other data sets targeted for 
AI/ML.  Fifth,  AI- READI  addresses  challenges  that  have 
compromised  AI  implementation  in  clinical  research 
by  including  ethical  and  equitable  data  collection  and 
management,  and  adherence  to  Findable,  Accessible, 
Interoperable,  Reusable  (FAIR)  principles.  These  issues 
have been discussed previously1 but are incorporated in 
administering the design and protocol described below.

METHODS
AI- READI was approved by the Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) of the University of Washington (approval number 
STUDY00016228),  including  reliance  agreements  with 
the  IRBs  of  University  of  Alabama  at  Birmingham  and 
University  of  California,  San  Diego.  Written  informed 
consent is provided by all participants.

Patient and public involvement
A  Community  Advisory  Board  of  11  persons  from  the 
three  sites  including  diversity  in  race  and  ethnicity  as 
represented  in  the  AI- READI  sample  contributes  to  the 
development of the protocol.

Design
AI- READI  is  a  cross- sectional  study  whose  target  enrol-
ment is 4000 people aged 40 and older, triple- balanced by

diabetes, 

self- reported race/ethnicity, T2DM presence and severity, 
and  biological  sex  (figure  1).  Building  balanced  data 
sets is critical for the development of unbiased machine 
learning  models,  so  rather  than  targeting  the  demo-
graphic  distribution  of  the  US  population,  the  study  is 
triple- balanced by recruiting the following populations in 
equal proportions: four race/ethnic groups (Asian, black, 
white, Hispanic), four categories of T2DM (no diabetes, 
pre- diabetes/lifestyle- controlled 
diabetes 
treated  with  oral  medications  or  non- insulin- injectable 
medications, and insulin- controlled diabetes) and biolog-
ical males and females. Participants are recruited across 
three data collection sites in different geographical loca-
tions:  Birmingham,  Alabama  (University  of  Alabama  at 
Birmingham  (UAB)),  San  Diego,  California  (University 
of  California,  San  Diego  (UCSD)),  and  Seattle,  Wash-
ington  (University  of  Washington  (UW)).  All  study 
groups are recruited from each site to capture diversity, 
but the proportion of each group will vary depending on 
the  demographic  prevalence  of  each  group  in  the  site’s 
geographical  area.  Participants  are  required  to  speak, 
read  and  understand  English.  Pregnancy  and  type  1 
diabetes are exclusionary for participation.

Source population
The study base is all patients aged ≥40 years of age who 
had a medical encounter within each health system site 
(UAB, UCSD, UW) between 2020 and 2025. Patients with 
T2DM and pre- diabetes are identified by screening elec-
tronic health records for ICD- 10 diagnosis codes R73.09 
and E11.X, respectively. Patients without diabetes will not 
have encounters with these ICD codes.

Recruitment
Enrolment began on 18 July 2023 and will continue until 
30  November  2026.  Participants  are  recruited  in  waves 
to facilitate the efficient sampling of the study base. The 
composition and size of each wave are influenced by the 
observed  participation  characteristics  of  race/ethnicity, 
gender,  severity  of  T2DM  and  site,  according  to  health 
records.  As  recruitment  progresses,  the  composition  of 
participants is monitored in terms of diversity and inclu-
sion  and  will  be  adjusted  by  under-  and  oversampling 
groups as needed. Recruitment in waves also allows suffi-
cient  time  for  coordinators  to  respond  to  persons  who 
are interested and follow- up on mailings with expediency. 
For  each  recruitment  wave,  a  contact  pool  is  identified 
by screening electronic health records at each site. Indi-
viduals  in  each  pool  are  mailed  a  hardcopy  invitation 
letter and sent an invitation email, both personalised to 
direct  them  into  our  online  REDCap  recruitment  inter-
face using links, access codes and QR codes. Once in the 
REDCap  interface,  individuals  can  read  an  overview  of 
the  research  programme,  expectations  for  participation 
and answers to Frequently Asked Questions. They are also 
given the opportunity to download the informed consent 
document, request a call back from study staff, complete 
a screening survey for qualification and enroll by signing

Figure 1  This project is generating an accessible, shared data set that includes a diverse set of health and behavioural 
domains and is harmonised across all variables to be artificial intelligence and machine learning ready. Descriptions of variables 
are available in tables 1–4. BMI, body mass index; OCTA, optical coherence tomography angiography.

our electronic consent. Once enrolled, they have access 
to  study  questionnaires  (see  below).  Those  who  do  not 
have access to the internet may call research staff for alter-
native methods of enrolment.

Protocol
The protocol is performed as a single visit lasting between 
2.5  and  4 hours,  depending  on  the  participant.  Partic-
ipants  are  volunteers;  therefore,  there  is  selection  bias 
known  as  volunteer  bias  which  may  limit  the  generalis-
ability  of  the  results  among  those  who  are  not  repre-
sented  in  the  study  population.  For  most  participants, 
informed  consent  is  performed  remotely  by  computer, 
tablet or smart phone through a link in the hardcopy invi-
tation letter or the invitation email which directed them 
into  our  REDCap  database.  Once  enrolled,  participants 
are presented with questionnaires for online completion. 
If participants did not select the option to consent elec-
tronically,  it  is  performed  in- person  at  the  start  of  the 
visit, followed by the completion of all questionnaires. All 
research personnel at the three data sites who recruited, 
enrolled  and  collected  data  underwent  training  by  the 
data  manager  at  UAB  and  a  detailed  Manual  of  Proce-
dures  (MOP)  for  reference.  Successful  completion  of 
a  certification  process  is  required  for  all  coordinators, 

involved  mandatory 

which 
institutional  compliance 
training  for  human  subject  research.  In  addition,  prior 
to enrolling and testing participants, all coordinators are 
required to successfully administer all protocol elements 
to at least three volunteer practice subjects, meeting the 
standards  outlined  in  the  MOP.  Data  managers  at  each 
site  oversee  the  process.  Preliminary  pilot  enrolment 
occurred between 18 July 2023 and 30 November 2023 in 
order to secure sufficient familiarity for all coordinators. 
The formal data collection process began on 1 December 
2023. Preliminary data from the pilot enrollment period 
were  included  in  the  first  released  data  set  released 
in  May  2024.  A  subsequent  version  of  the  data  set  that 
includes all data collected in the first year of the study (up 
to 31 July 2024) is planned for release in November 2024.

Figure 1 presents information on all the data domains 
collected in AI- READI. Questionnaires addressed several 
content domains as listed in table 1. Height, weight and 
waist  and  hip  circumference  are  measured,  followed  by 
calculation  of  the  waist- hip  ratio  and  body  mass  index. 
Systolic  blood  pressure,  diastolic  blood  pressure  and

an  automatic  oscillometric,  medically  approved  device. 
A  12- lead  ECG  is  performed  (Philips  Pagewriter  TC30 
Cardiograph,  Amsterdam,  The  Netherlands)  while  the 
participant sits in a reclining chair or lies supine; the posi-
tion is recorded (0°, 30°, 60° or 90°) relative to the supine 
position.  Peripheral  neuropathy  is  performed  using  the 
monofilament test11 assessing touch perception on both 
feet  with  shoes  and  socks  removed.  During  testing,  the 
participants’  eyes  are  closed  while  responding  yes/no 
whether  they  feel  the  10 g  filament  in  three  locations 
on  each  foot  (10  times  per  location).  A  general  cogni-
tive screener is carried out using the Montreal Cognitive 
Assessment12 (MoCA), administered electronically on an 
iPad using the MoCA Duo Application (MoCA Cognition, 
Quebec,  Canada).  The  total  possible  score  is  30,  with 
higher numbers representing better performance.

Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity are assessed under 
both  photopic  (daylight)  conditions  and  mesopic  (dim 
light) conditions. The right and left eyes are tested sepa-
rately. Photopic letter visual acuity is measured with the 
Electronic Visual Acuity tester13 (M&S Technology, Niles, 
Illinois) using the instrument’s routine protocol. Mesopic 
acuity is measured by the participant viewing the display 
through a 2.0 neutral density (ND) filter which reduces 
the light level of the test to a mesopic level.14 Visual acuity 
is measured while the participant views the display under 
best- corrected conditions, expressed as the logarithm of 
the  minimum  angle  of  resolution.  Lower  numbers  are 
better  resolution.  Photopic  letter  contrast  sensitivity  is 
measured  with  the  Mars  chart  (Mars  Perceptrix,  Chap-
paqua, New York)15 using the routine procedure. Mesopic 
contrast sensitivity is assessed by viewing through the 2.0 

ND filter. Contrast sensitivity is expressed as log sensitivity, 
with  higher  numbers  meaning  better  sensitivity.  Autore-
fraction  data  for  each  eye  are  obtained  (spherical  and 
cylindrical  components  expressed  as  diopter  with  cylin-
drical  axis)  using  the  autorefractor’s  standard  protocol 
(Topcon  KR  800,  Topcon  Healthcare,  Oakland,  New 
Jersey).

Blood  (non- fasting)  and  urine  samples  are  collected 
from  participants  during  the  visit.  Whole  blood,  blood 
derivatives  and  urine  are  used  for  clinical  lab  testing, 
summarised in table 2. Clinical Laboratory Improvement 
Amendments- certified  laboratories  local  to  each  data 
collection  site  perform  complete  blood  count  (CBC) 
testing on fresh whole blood samples; all other lab tests 
are performed by the University of Washington Nutrition 
and  Obesity  Research  Center  (NORC)  testing  facility 
using  stored,  frozen  samples.  Additionally,  blood  deriv-
atives  are  sent  to  the  biorepository  at  UAB’s  Center  for 
Clinical  and  Translational  Science  (CCTS)  and  will  be 
available  to  researchers  for  future  ancillary  studies  (see 
table  3  for  a  summary  and  detailed  discussion  of  the 
biorepository).

The  retinal  imaging  protocol  is  designed  to  capture 
imaging  from  multiple  devices.  Both  eyes  are  imaged 
on  each  participant.  Table  4  details  the  scans  and  data 
formats  used  for  each  retinal  imaging  device.  The 
imaging  devices  were  chosen  due  to  their  different,  yet 
partially overlapping, modalities. The specific scan types 
were chosen to provide widespread coverage of the retina 
with  the  overarching  goal  of  detecting  pixel- level  differ-
ences in pathology. All retinal images are collected under 
dilated conditions, except for the Optomed (see table 4).

*Reference range is a set of values that represent low and high ends of results that are considered normal. The above 
reference ranges were provided by the testing laboratories.
HbA1c, hemoglobin A1c; iPSCs, induced pluripotent stem cells; MCH, mean corpuscular hemoglobin; MCHC, mean 
corpuscular hemobglobin concentration; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; RDW, red blood cell distribution width.

All participant images are exported from imaging devices 
in  their  raw  format  and  some  images  required  conver-
sion to a DICOM standard format prior to upload to an 
external AI- READI data storage site (discussed below).

At  the  end  of  their  in- person  visit,  participants  are 
sent  home  with  three  data  monitoring  devices  as  listed 
in  table  4:  (1)  home  environmental  sensor,  (2)  Garmin 
fitness  tracker  and  (3)  Dexcom  Continuous  Glucose 
Monitor  (CGM).  Coordinators  provide  instructions  on 
how to use these monitoring devices continuously for 10 
days. Participants are instructed to return the devices to 
study staff by overnight mail (mailing materials and fees 
provided by the site) or in- person after 10 days. The envi-
ronmental  sensor  and  the  Garmin  fitness  tracker  were 
specifically  chosen  with  participant  privacy  as  a  primary 
concern. These devices do not capture video or audio, are 
not equipped with GPS location monitoring and are not 
synced  with  participant- owned  devices.  Participants  are 
masked to the results from the Dexcom CGM during the 
monitoring  period.  Participants  return  the  monitoring 
devices with a data sheet indicating which wrist the fitness 
tracker was worn on, their dominant hand and where the 
environmental sensor was placed in the home.

The  following  results  are  returned  to  participants 
either as they leave the visit or later by HIPAA- compliant, 
encrypted  email.  Results  from  heart  rate,  blood  pres-
sure  and  visual  acuity  assessments  are  provided  to  the 
participant  on  an  exam  card  before  they  leave  the  visit, 
along  with  instructions  in  lay  language  for  interpreting 
the data and any follow- up recommendations. Following 
the 10- day at- home monitoring period, a Dexcom report 
providing average blood glucose levels (hourly, daily and 

overall) and an overall Glucose Management Indicator is 
provided  by  encrypted  email.  At  the  time  of  the  yearly 
data  release  (see  below),  laboratory  test  results  are  sent 
with  information  on  normative  values  by  Health  Insur-
ance Portabillity and Accountability- compliant, encrypted 
email.

Coordinators  alert  participants  to  several  incidental 
findings before they leave a visit. Participants are recom-
mended  to  go  for  emergency  care  for  the  following 
reasons: individuals with systolic blood pressure readings 
of  over  180 mm  Hg  or  less  than  100 mm  Hg  (with  any 
symptoms  of  haemodynamic  instability),  diastolic  blood 
pressure readings of greater than 120 mm Hg or less than 
60 mm Hg (along with any symptoms of haemodynamic 
instability) or heart rate readings of greater than 100 bpm 
or less than 60 bpm (if not known to be usual for them 
and  with  any  symptoms  of  haemodynamic  instability). 
Retinal imaging technicians are trained to detect certain 
conditions that are potentially life or vision threatening 
(retinal detachment, tumour and optic disc oedema). If 
one of these conditions is suspected, immediate follow- up 
with  the  participant  is  performed  with  a  referral  to  the 
emergency  department  (disc  oedema)  or  referral  to  an 
ophthalmologist for immediate care (retinal detachment, 
tumour).

Data management
REDCap is used for collecting patient- reported data from 
questionnaires  and  the  following  clinical  data  from  the 
visit: medications assessment, vitals, visual acuity, contrast 
sensitivity, monofilament test results and CBC test results. 
Data from the following devices are exported in their raw

format to local storage: ECG (.xml), MoCA Duo applica-
tion (total score, section subscores, Memory Index Score 
and task completion times; .csv), retinal imaging (table 4) 
and at- home monitoring devices (environmental sensors, 
CGMs, fitness trackers; Table 3). Blood and urine testing 
by the NORC lab is provided in .csv format. All data are 
mapped to applicable data standard formats, such as the 
Observational  Medical  Outcomes  Partnership  Common 
Data Model for clinical data and the DICOM format for 
retinal  imaging.  All  data  are  uploaded  at  regular  inter-
vals to the AI- READI- specific data management platform 
called FAIRhub (https://fairhub.io/), a Microsoft Azure 
cloud- based platform developed for this project. For some 
devices,  the  data  are  transformed  from  its  proprietary 
state  into  a  standard  model  format  prior  to  upload  to 
FAIRhub (tables 3 and 4). The Data Manager at each data 
site is responsible for the quality control of all data before 
uploading  to  FAIRhub.  All  data  are  stored  and  shared 
using  FAIRhub  as  ‘AI- ready’  which  enables  immediate 

AI/ML research without reformatting and preprocessing. 
More  details  about  the  AI- readiness  of  the  data  set  are 
provided  in  the  data  set  documentation  (https://docs. 
aireadi.org/).

Data availability
A  more  detailed  explanation  of  FAIRhub  was  provided 
previously1  and  at  https://aireadi.org.  Deidentified 
data  are  released  approximately  yearly  in  two  data  sets: 
a  controlled  access  set  and  publicly  accessible  set  with 
fewer requirements for access. The controlled access data 
set  contains  all  data  available  in  the  publicly  accessible 
set,  plus  more  sensitive  data  that  are  only  available  for 
use by scientists whose institutions have completed legal 
and privacy use agreements with the AI- READI research 
programme.  The  publicly  accessible  data  set  from  pilot 
data collection was made available in May 2024. All data 
collected  through  31  July  2024  were  made  available 
in  November  2024.16  Information  regarding  data  set

Access Committee.

Biospecimen processing and repository
Blood  (53 mL)  is  collected  for  clinical  lab  assays  and 
biobanking  purposes,  and  a  urine  specimen  is  also 
collected  during  the  study  encounter  (table  2).  The 
collection  materials,  sample  type,  specimen  handling 

and  location  details  are  summarised  in  table  3.  Local 
processing  for  plasma,  serum  and  buffy  coats 
is 
performed  using  standardised  operating  procedures, 
ensuring consistent handling of these biospecimens for 
subsequent  biobanking  and  clinical  lab  analyses.  One 
EDTA vacutainer is dedicated for delivery to a local clin-
ical  testing  lab  for  CBC  analysis.  Whole  blood,  plasma, 
serum and urine collected for central clinical lab assays 
are  batch- shipped  to  the  UW  NORC  on  a  regular  basis

(table  3).  Likewise,  plasma,  serum  and  buffy  coats 
collected at UW and UCSD are batch- shipped to the UAB 
CCTS for integration into a central study- wide biobank. 
Genomic  DNA  extractions  from  stored  buffy  coats  are 
performed at UAB CCTS. Because of the complexity in 
isolating and cryopreserving peripheral blood mononu-
clear  cells  (PBMCs),  centralised  processing  of  the  CPT 
tubes occurs at the UAB CCTS. While this strategy does 
introduce  an  additional  time  variable  for  isolation  and 
cryopreservation of PBMC from participants recruited at 
UW and UCSD, the ability to pre- centrifuge these tubes 
locally  followed  by  overnight  delivery  to  UAB  allows 
for  consistency  in  initial  vacutainer  handling.  Finally, 
the  PAXgene  RNA  vacutainers  are  stable  for  up  to  72 
hours  after  collection,  allowing  for  overnight  shipment 
of  vacutainers  from  UW  and  UCSD  to  the  UAB  CCTS. 
Biobanked samples will eventually be available to scien-
tists  according  to  procedures  and  policies  that  are  in 
development.

AI- READI  has  several  strengths  which  make  it  highly 
suitable  for  AI/ML  studies  on  T2DM.  The  targeted 
sample size of 4000 persons is the largest publicly acces-
sible data set currently available containing many multi-
domain  variables  relevant  to  T2DM.  Furthermore,  after 
1 year  of  enrolment,  the  sites  are  currently  on  schedule 
for reaching a final sample of 4000 persons within 3 years 
of  data  collection.  The  sample  will  be  approximately 
balanced  with  respect  to  Asians,  blacks,  Hispanics  and 
whites, a demographic improvement over many previous 
epidemiological  and  clinical  trials  on  T2DM.  A  meta- 
epidemiological review of T2DM studies published from 
2000  to  2020  indicated  that  samples  lacked  racial  and 
ethnic  diversity,17  thus  making  AI- READI  an  important 
step forward in addressing these demographic inequities 
in research. The study design process enacted ethical and 
equitable  data  collection  and  management  practices,  as 
well as data sharing with adherence to the FAIR principles.
Challenges  will  also  be  encountered.  It  is  a  well- 
documented  observation 
that 
recruiting  black  men  into  studies  is  more  difficult  than 
recruiting  other  populations,18  yet  this  population 
represents  a  disproportionate  percentage  of  burden  in 
T2DM.19  Factors  such  as  medical  mistrust  and  fear  of 
safety  stem  from  historical  events  such  as  the  Tuskegee 
syphilis study.20 Researchers have identified strategies to 
encourage  interest  among  black  men  to  participate  in 
research such as tailoring printed materials and using a 
personalised,  participatory  approach  to  recruitment.21 
These  trends  for  under- recruitment  and  for  disease 
burden  have  also  been  reported  for  Hispanic22  and 
Asian  persons.23  If  sample  balancing  on  race/ethnicity 
emerges as a challenge in AI- READI, we will implement 
new  recruitment  strategies  to  overcome  the  imbalance. 
Requiring that eligible participants speak, read and under-
stand English may have created challenges in recruiting 
Hispanic and/or Asian persons. A limitation of our biore-
pository  is  that  there  are  a  finite  number  of  samples  to 
share with scientists interested in using them in research.

Open access

Procedures for reviewing and prioritising written requests 
will be developed before the biorepository is complete.

In  summary,  AI- READI  is  an  NIH  Common  Fund 
Bridge2AI- supported data collection effort to generate a 
4000- person data set with T2DM that is suitable for AI/
ML.  It  is  triple- balanced  with  respect  to  race/ethnicity, 
biological  sex  and  T2DM  severity  (including  those  who 
do not have T2DM). It is multimodal with over 10 variable 
domains that can be associated with adverse conditions in 
T2DM, yet it is hypothesis agnostic. AI- READI emphasises 
making  data  ‘AI- ready’  and  establishing  standards,  best 
practices and guidelines for collection, preparation and 
sharing  of  the  data.  This  approach  can  be  viewed  as  an 
example  for  future  efforts  to  develop  other  health  data 
sets  targeted  for  AI/ML.  AI- READI  opens  the  door  for 
novel insights into understanding T2DM salutogenesis.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
AI- READI aims to establish standards, best practices and 
guidelines for collection, preparation and sharing of the 
data for the purposes of AI/ML, including guidance from 
bioethicists.  Following  FAIR  principles,  AI- READI  can 
be viewed as a model for future efforts to develop other 
medical/health data sets targeted for AI/ML. AI- READI 
opens  the  door  for  novel  insights  into  understanding 
T2DM  salutogenesis.  The  AI- READI  Consortium  are 
disseminating  the  principles  and  processes  of  designing 
and implementing the AI- READI data set through publi-
cations.  Those  who  download  and  use  AI- READI  data 
are  encouraged  to  publish  their  results  in  the  scientific 
literature.
