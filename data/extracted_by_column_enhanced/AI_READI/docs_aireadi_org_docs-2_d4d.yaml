name: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
description: >
  The AI-READI dataset consists of multimodal data collected from individuals
  with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and harmonized across three
  data collection sites. Designed for future AI/ML studies, recruitment aimed
  to achieve approximately equal distribution of participants across diabetes
  severity. A standardized data acquisition protocol spans multiple domains
  (surveys, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging, wearable devices,
  ECG, laboratory results, blood glucose, and environmental variables such as
  home air quality) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that are not feasible
  with claims or electronic health records alone. Some non-sensitive data are
  publicly downloadable under a license agreement; the full dataset, including
  sensitive elements, is available under a data use agreement (controlled
  access). As enrollment is ongoing, pilot release(s) and periodic updates may
  not be balanced across groups.

purposes:
  - response: >
      Advance AI/ML research to better understand salutogenesis (pathway from
      disease to health) in T2DM using harmonized, multimodal human subject data.
tasks:
  - response: >
      Development and evaluation of AI/ML methods on multimodal T2DM-related
      data, including modeling, prediction, and analysis across clinical,
      imaging, wearable, laboratory, and environmental domains.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Enable downstream AI/ML analyses across multiple domains that are not
      feasible using existing data sources such as claims or electronic health
      records alone by providing harmonized, multi-site, multi-domain data.
instances:
  - representation: Individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM)
    instance_type: Human participants and associated multimodal measurements collected across three clinical sites
    data_type: >
      Multimodal observations per participant including survey data, physical
      measurements, clinical measurements (e.g., monofilament and cognitive
      function testing), retinal images, ECG, wearable device data, blood and
      urine laboratory results, blood glucose levels, and environmental variables
      (e.g., home air quality). Controlled-access components include genetic
      sequencing data and past health records.
    sampling_strategies:
      - is_sample:
          - 'yes'
        is_random:
          - 'no'
        source_data:
          - Participants recruited at three clinical sites under a standardized protocol
        is_representative:
          - >
            Recruitment aimed at approximately equal distribution across diabetes
            severity; actual pilot release(s) may not be balanced due to ongoing
            enrollment.
        why_not_representative:
          - Enrollment ongoing; pilot release and periodic updates may not achieve balance across groups.
        strategies:
          - Stratified recruitment targeting approximately equal distribution by diabetes severity
subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - With T2DM vs. without T2DM
      - Diabetes severity strata
    distribution:
      - >
        Recruitment targeted approximately equal distribution across diabetes
        severity; pilot release(s) may be imbalanced due to ongoing enrollment.
sensitive_elements:
  - description:
      - >
        Controlled-access data include 5-digit ZIP code, sex, race, ethnicity,
        genetic sequencing data, past health records, medications, and traffic
        and accident reports.
confidential_elements:
  - description:
      - >
        Past health records and related clinical information may include PHI and
        data protected by medical confidentiality; these are under controlled access.
is_deidentified:
  description:
    - >
      Public dataset excludes sensitive personal health data and is available
      under a license agreement; full dataset includes sensitive elements and
      is accessible only under a data use agreement (controlled access).
acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - >
        Data were collected directly from participants (surveys, physical and
        clinical measurements, wearable devices, imaging, and ECG), and some
        elements were obtained or derived from existing records (e.g., past
        health records) and genetic sequencing.

    was_reported_by_subjects: 'yes'
    was_inferred_derived: 'yes'
collection_mechanisms:
  - description:
      - >
        Standardized, harmonized acquisition protocol across three sites using
        clinical instruments (e.g., monofilament testing), imaging devices
        (retinal imaging), ECG, wearable devices, laboratory testing for blood
        and urine, participant surveys, and environmental sensing (home air quality).
