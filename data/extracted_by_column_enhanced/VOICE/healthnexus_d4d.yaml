title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information v1.0"
description: >-
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a comprehensive collection of data derived from voice
  recordings linked to corresponding clinical information to enable research on
  voice as a biomarker of health. Version 1.0 provides 12,523 recordings for
  306 participants collected across five sites in North America. Participants
  were selected based on conditions known to manifest in the voice waveform
  (voice, neurological, mood/psychiatric, and respiratory disorders). This
  initial release contains low-risk derived data (e.g., spectrograms and
  extracted features) and detailed demographic/clinical/questionnaire data; raw
  audio waveforms are not included in v1.0.

purposes:
  - name: Purpose
    response: >-
      Create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to enable AI research on
      voice as a biomarker of health by linking derived voice data with
      demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire information.
tasks:
  - name: Intended tasks
    response: >-
      Develop and evaluate AI/ML methods for detecting, characterizing, and
      monitoring health conditions from voice-derived representations and
      associated clinical data.
addressing_gaps:
  - name: Gap addressed
    response: >-
      Addresses the lack of large, diverse, multi-institutional voice datasets
      linked to health information with standardized collection protocols and
      ethical oversight; mitigates prior limitations such as small datasets and
      limited demographic diversity reporting.
