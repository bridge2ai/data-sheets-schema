title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a comprehensive, ethically sourced dataset linking derived voice
  recordings to clinical and demographic information to advance research on voice as a
  biomarker of health. Version 1.0 (released Nov 27, 2024) includes 12,523 recordings from
  306 adult participants across five North American sites. This initial release contains
  low-risk derived data (e.g., spectrograms and acoustic/phonetic features) and detailed
  demographics, clinical data, and validated questionnaire responses. Original audio
  waveforms are omitted in this release; transcripts of free speech are removed. The
  dataset supports AI research across cohorts including voice disorders, neurological
  disorders, mood/psychiatric disorders, and respiratory disorders.

purposes:
  - response: >
      Create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to enable AI research on voice as
      a biomarker of health and support insights across multiple clinical domains.
tasks:
  - response: >
      Develop and evaluate AI/ML methods for health-related inference from voice, including
      detection, classification, and risk stratification across specified disorder cohorts.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Lack of large, high-quality, multi-institutional, demographically diverse voice datasets
      linked to health information and collected under standardized, ethically grounded protocols.
