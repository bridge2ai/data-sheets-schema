title: "Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project"
description: >
  This dataset contains data from 1067 participants (collected between July 19,
  2023 and July 31, 2024) as part of the AI-READI project. Data are multimodal,
  contain no PHI, and specifically exclude sex, race/ethnicity, and medication
  information to enhance privacy protection. Its size is approximately 2.01 TB
  across 165,051 files. The dataset is intended to enable AI/ML research on
  type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), focusing on disease trajectories, salutogenic
  pathways, and equitable research practices. See docs.aireadi.org (v2.0.0) for
  detailed descriptions, data structure, and usage guidelines.

## MOTIVATION-RELATED FIELDS
purposes:
  - response: >
      The dataset was created to support AI/ML research into type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM), with a focus on understanding complex disease trajectories and
      salutogenic pathways.
tasks:
  - response: >
      Primary tasks include disease staging, progression analysis, manifold
      modeling for pseudo-time analysis, and other T2DM-related analytics.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      It addresses a lack of large, high-quality, ethically sourced, and
      inclusively designed multimodal datasets in the T2DM domain.

        Contains health data related to T2DM. However, all PHI and direct
        identifiers (including race/ethnicity, sex, and medication usage) have
        been removed to reduce sensitivity risks.
is_deidentified:
  identifiable_elements_present: false
  description:
    - >
      Directly identifying information (PHI) was removed. The study uses
      participant ID numbers instead of names or other identifying details.

## COLLECTION-RELATED FIELDS
acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - >
        Data gathered through direct clinical measures (e.g., ECG, wearable
        devices), environmental sensors, and imaging techniques (OCT, FLIO,
        etc.). The dataset includes cross-sectional data (N=1067) and a planned
        longitudinal subset (~10% of participants).
    was_directly_observed: true
    was_reported_by_subjects: true
    was_inferred_derived: false
    was_validated_verified: true
collection_mechanisms:
  - description:
      - >
        The data were collected via standardized clinical protocols, including
        12-lead ECG, wearable activity monitors, continuous glucose monitors,
        retinal imaging (OCT, OCTA, FLIO, photography), and custom
        environmental sensors. Clinical data were collected via REDCap forms.
data_collectors:
  - description:
      - >
        Trained research coordinators and clinical staff from AI-READI project
        sites collected data; participants were compensated. Some data points
        were self-reported via questionnaires.
collection_timeframes:
  - description:
      - >
        Data in this version (v2.0.0) covers collection from July 19, 2023 to
        July 31, 2024. Additional data will be integrated in future releases.
ethical_reviews:
  - description:
      - >
        The study was reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board
        (IRB). For details, refer to the study_description.json and IRB
        documentation at docs.aireadi.org.
data_protection_impacts:
  - description:
      - >
        A data protection impact assessment was performed to ensure compliance
        with relevant regulatory frameworks, focusing on secure handling and
        anonymization of participant data.

## PREPROCESSING-CLEANING-LABELING FIELDS
preprocessing_strategies:
  - description:
      - >
        Data were harmonized to the Clinical Dataset Structure (CDS) v0.1.1
        standard. Certain fields (e.g., race, sex) were removed for privacy.
cleaning_strategies:
  - description:
      - >
        PHI was systematically removed. Missing values were left unaltered
        unless irreparable, in which case records were flagged or removed to
        preserve data integrity.
labeling_strategies:
  - description:
      - >
        No explicit "label" fields were added; the dataset is not strictly
        labeled for classification tasks, though certain columns in clinical
        data map to relevant T2DM outcomes or statuses.

## USES FIELDS
