  description: >
    This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org),
    the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq
    data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, 
    neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of 
    chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich 
    metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will 
    be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, 
    Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center. This data is Copyright (c) 2025
