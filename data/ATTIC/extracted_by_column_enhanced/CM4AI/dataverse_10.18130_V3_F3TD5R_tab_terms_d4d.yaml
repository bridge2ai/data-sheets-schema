instances:
  - name: Data modalities and instance structure
    representation: Cell-based measurements and derived observations across multiple experimental modalities.
    instance_type: Immunofluorescence images, size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) profiles, and CRISPRi perturb-seq single-cell transcriptomes.
    data_type: Raw and processed data files per modality (confocal ICC-IF images with multi-channel staining; SEC-MS protein abundance/interaction fractions; scRNA-seq counts/metadata from perturb-seq).
    label: Yes; instances include protein of interest and treatment condition (e.g., paclitaxel, vorinostat, untreated) for imaging; perturbation identity for perturb-seq; sample and condition metadata for SEC-MS.
