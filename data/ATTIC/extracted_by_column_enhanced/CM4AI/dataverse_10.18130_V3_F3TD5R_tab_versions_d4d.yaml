title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  This dataset is the June 2025 Beta Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
  (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program.
  The release includes: CRISPRi perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; size
  exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs,
  iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
  cells; and immunofluorescence (IF) images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells with and without
  chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). Human subjects: No. De-identified samples: Yes. FDA
  regulated: No. Some datasets are under temporary pre-publication embargo. Computed cell maps
  are not included in this release.
