description: >
  This dataset is the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence
  (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI
  program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J
  iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons,
  cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells; and IF
  images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy
  (vorinostat and paclitaxel).
