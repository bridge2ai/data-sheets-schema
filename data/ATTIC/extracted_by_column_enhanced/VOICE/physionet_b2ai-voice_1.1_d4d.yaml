title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a comprehensive, ethically sourced dataset derived from voice
  recordings linked to clinical information to enable research on voice as a biomarker
  of health. Version 1.1 provides derived data (e.g., spectrograms, MFCCs, static
  acoustic features) and rich phenotype information for a cohort initially comprising
  adults. The initial release (v1.0) included 12,523 recordings from 306 participants
  collected across five sites in North America, selected from five disease cohort
  categories (voice disorders, neurological/neurodegenerative disorders, mood/psychiatric
  disorders, respiratory disorders, and pediatric; v1.1 contains adult cohort data).
  To reduce re-identification risk, only derived data are shared in this version;
  raw audio waveforms are excluded. Data collection followed a standardized, multi-site
  protocol, with de-identification aligned to HIPAA Safe Harbor.

    response: >
      Create an ethically sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information
      to enable AI research on voice as a biomarker and support clinical insights across
      multiple disease areas.
tasks:
  - id: task-1
    name: Intended Task
    response: >
      Develop and evaluate AI methods for health-related inference from voice,
      including detection and characterization of conditions associated with acoustic
      changes (e.g., voice, neurological, mood, and respiratory disorders) using
      derived features (spectrograms, MFCCs) and phenotype data.

    name: Addressing Gap
    response: >
      Addresses the lack of large, high-quality, ethically sourced, multi-institutional,
      and demographically diverse voice datasets linked to clinical and questionnaire
      data for reproducible AI research.
