title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: The Bridge2AI-Voice project provides an ethically sourced, multi-institutional, diverse dataset linking derived representations of human voice to detailed clinical and demographic information to enable research on voice as a biomarker of health. Version 1.0 includes derived data (e.g., spectrograms and acoustic features) for 12,523 recordings from 306 adult participants across five North American sites, with associated phenotype data and validated questionnaires. Original audio waveforms are not included in this initial release to minimize re-identification risk; transcripts of free speech are also removed.

          grant_number: 3OT2OD032720-01S1
    purposes:
      - name: Purpose
        response: Create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to enable AI research into voice as a biomarker of health, linking voice-derived data with clinical and demographic information.
    tasks:
      - name: Intended tasks
        response: Research on voice as a biomarker of health, including disease screening, diagnostic support, and therapeutic monitoring across voice, neurological, mood/psychiatric, and respiratory disorders.
    addressing_gaps:
      - name: Gap addressed
        response: Lack of large, high-quality, multi-institutional, and demographically diverse voice datasets linked to health information, with standardized protocols and ethical oversight.
    instances:
      - name: Instance definition
        representation: Voice recordings with associated clinical and demographic information; dataset contains only derived representations (e.g., spectrograms, acoustic, phonetic, and prosodic features) in v1.0.
        instance_type: Participants, recording sessions, and tasks mapped to derived spectrogram arrays and per-recording static features.
        data_type: Derived data including spectrograms (513 x N), OpenSMILE acoustic features, Parselmouth/Praat phonetic and prosodic measures, torchaudio-derived features, and phenotype tables.
        counts: 12523
        label: Clinical and demographic labels, disease cohort membership, and validated questionnaire responses.
