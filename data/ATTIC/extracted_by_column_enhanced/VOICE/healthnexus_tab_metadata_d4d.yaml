title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 is a restricted-access dataset enabling research into
  voice as a biomarker of health. The initial release provides 12,523 recordings
  for 306 adult participants collected across five sites in North America, with
  accompanying demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data. To reduce
  re-identification risk, only derived data are released (e.g., spectrograms and
  extracted acoustic/phonetic features); original audio waveforms and free-speech
  transcripts are not included. Participants were selected from cohorts with
  conditions known to manifest in voice (voice disorders, neurological and
  neurodegenerative disorders, mood and psychiatric disorders, and respiratory
  disorders). Standardized collection protocols were used; raw audio was converted
  to mono, resampled to 16 kHz with a Butterworth anti-aliasing filter, and used
  to compute STFT spectrograms and features (openSMILE, Praat/Parselmouth,
  torchaudio). Transcriptions were generated using Whisper Large but free speech
  transcripts were removed for release.
