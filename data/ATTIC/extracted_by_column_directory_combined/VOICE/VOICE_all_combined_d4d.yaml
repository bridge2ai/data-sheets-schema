title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >-
  The Bridge2AI-Voice project seeks to create an ethically sourced flagship
  dataset to enable future research in artificial intelligence and support
  critical insights into the use of voice as a biomarker of health. Bridge2AI-Voice
  v1.0 provides 12,523 recordings for 306 participants collected across five
  sites in North America. Participants were selected based on known conditions
  which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders,
  neurological disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders. The initial
  release contains data considered low risk, including derivations such as
  spectrograms but not the original voice recordings. Detailed demographic,
  clinical, and validated questionnaire data are also made available.
