title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: >-
  Bridge2AI-Voice is a comprehensive, ethically sourced dataset of voice-derived
  data linked to health information to enable research on voice as a biomarker
  of health. Version 1.0 contains 12,523 recordings from 306 participants
  collected across five sites in North America. Participants were selected from
  cohorts with conditions known to manifest in voice (voice disorders,
  neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, mood and psychiatric disorders,
  respiratory disorders; adult cohort only in v1.0). To reduce re-identification
  risk, the initial release includes low-risk derived data (e.g., spectrograms
  and acoustic/phonetic features) and phenotype data (demographics, clinical
  questionnaires), but excludes raw audio waveforms and free-speech transcripts.

purposes:
  - name: purpose
    response: >-
      Create an ethically sourced flagship dataset to advance AI research on
      voice as a biomarker of health and support critical insights into links
      between voice and clinical conditions.
tasks:
  - name: primary_tasks
    response: >-
      AI/ML research on voice-derived representations; analysis of spectrograms
      and acoustic/phonetic features for associations with health conditions and
      related biomarkers.
addressing_gaps:
  - name: dataset_gap
    response: >-
      Addresses the lack of large, high-quality, multi-institutional, diverse
      voice datasets linked to health information, with standardized collection
      protocols and comprehensive demographic/clinical data.

      Participants, recording sessions, derived spectrogram arrays, static
      feature vectors, and participant-level phenotype records.

      Derived spectrograms (513 x N), acoustic features (openSMILE), phonetic
      and prosodic measures (Parselmouth/Praat), and participant phenotype data
