title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information (version 1.0)"
description: >
  Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 is an ethically-sourced, multi-institutional voice dataset linked to health
  information to enable research into using voice as a biomarker of health. The initial release
  provides 12,523 recordings from 306 adult participants collected across five sites in North America.
  Data considered low risk are released, including spectrograms and derived features (e.g., acoustic,
  phonetic, and prosodic features), along with detailed demographic, clinical, and validated
  questionnaire data. Original audio waveforms and transcripts of free speech are not included in v1.0.
