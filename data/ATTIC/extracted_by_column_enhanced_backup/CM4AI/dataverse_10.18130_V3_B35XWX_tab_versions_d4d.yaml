title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial
  Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in
  the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J
  iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in
  MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy
  (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance
  graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the
  FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through
  the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA,
  Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center. This
  data is Copyright (c) 2025 The Regents of the University of California except

addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Addresses the need for standardized, provenance-rich, AI-ready datasets
      linking functional genomics perturbations, proteomics complexes, and
      subcellular imaging in disease-relevant human cell lines.
