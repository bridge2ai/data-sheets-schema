title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  June 2025 Beta release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org),
  the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This release
  includes: (1) perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; (2) SEC-MS data
  in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and
  treated and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells; and (3) immunofluorescence (IF)
  images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy
  (vorinostat and paclitaxel). Some datasets are under temporary pre-publication embargo.
  Computed cell maps are not included in this release.
