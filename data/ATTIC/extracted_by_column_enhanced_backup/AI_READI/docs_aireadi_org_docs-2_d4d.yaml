name: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes (AI-READI)
description: >
  The AI-READI dataset consists of data collected from individuals with and
  without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three data
  collection sites. The study design targeted approximately equal distribution
  of participants across diabetes severity and implemented a multi-domain data
  acquisition protocol (e.g., survey data, physical measurements, clinical data,
  imaging data, wearable device data) to enable downstream AI/ML analyses that
  are not feasible with claims or electronic health records alone. Public data
  (non-sensitive personal health data) are available for download under a
  license; the full dataset is accessible via a data use agreement (DUA).
  Public data include survey data, blood and urine laboratory results, fitness
  activity levels, clinical measurements (e.g., monofilament and cognitive
  function testing), retinal images, ECG, blood sugar levels, and environmental
  variables (e.g., home air quality). Controlled-access data include 5-digit ZIP
  code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past health records,
  medications, and traffic and accident reports. Enrollment is ongoing; the
  pilot release and periodic updates may not have achieved balanced distribution
  across groups.
