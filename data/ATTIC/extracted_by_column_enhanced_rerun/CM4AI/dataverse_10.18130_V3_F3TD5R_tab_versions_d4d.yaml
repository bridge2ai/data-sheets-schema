title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - June 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: >
  This dataset is the June 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial
  Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in
  the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J
  iPSCs, iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated and untreated
  MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer
  cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel).
