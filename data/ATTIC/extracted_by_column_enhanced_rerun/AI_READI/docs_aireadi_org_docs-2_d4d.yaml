title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
description: >
  The AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes is a harmonized, multi-domain dataset
  collected across three data collection sites from individuals with and without Type 2
  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). It was designed with AI/Machine Learning applications in mind,
  including recruitment sampling to achieve approximately equal distribution across diabetes
  severity and a standardized data acquisition protocol covering survey data, physical and
  clinical measurements, imaging data, wearable device data, and environmental variables.
  The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in
  T2DM. A public subset excluding sensitive personal health data is available under a
  license; access to the full dataset requires a data use agreement (DUA). As enrollment is
  ongoing, the pilot data release and periodic updates may not have balanced distribution
  across groups.

    version: "2.0.0"
    description: >
      Multimodal participant-level dataset harmonized across three data collection
      sites, targeting approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity,
      and spanning survey responses, physical and clinical measurements, imaging,
      wearable device data, and environmental variables to enable downstream AI/ML
      analyses in T2DM. Public subset available under license; full dataset under DUA.
