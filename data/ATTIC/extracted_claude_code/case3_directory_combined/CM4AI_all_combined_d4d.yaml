title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) - 2025 Beta Data Releases
description: |-
  Combined documentation for the March 2025 and June 2025 Beta data releases of
  Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand
  Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. These releases include: (a) perturb-seq data in
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs); (b) protein-protein
  interaction data generated by size exclusion chromatography mass spectrometry (SEC-MS) across
  undifferentiated KOLF2.1J hiPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, cardiomyocytes, and treated
  and untreated MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells; and (c) immunofluorescence (IF) images of
  subcellular protein localization in MDA-MB-468 cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy
  (vorinostat and paclitaxel).
  
  CM4AI output data are packaged as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE
  framework, with provenance graphs and rich metadata. Data are augmented regularly through the
  end of the project (planned November 2026). Collaboration includes UC San Diego, UC San
  Francisco, Stanford University, University of Virginia, Yale University, University of Alabama
  at Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and The Hastings Center.
