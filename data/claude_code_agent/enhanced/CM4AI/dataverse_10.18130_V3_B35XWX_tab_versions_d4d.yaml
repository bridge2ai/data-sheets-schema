title: Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence - March 2025 Data Release (Beta)
description: "This dataset is the March 2025 Data Release of Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI; CM4AI.org), the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI program. This Beta release includes perturb-seq data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs; SEC-MS data in undifferentiated KOLF2.1J iPSCs and iPSC-derived NPCs, neurons, and cardiomyocytes; and IF images in MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells in the presence and absence of chemotherapy (vorinostat and paclitaxel). CM4AI output data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data presented here will be augmented regularly through the end of the project. CM4AI is a collaboration of UCSD, UCSF, Stanford, UVA, Yale, UA Birmingham, Simon Fraser University, and the Hastings Center.
