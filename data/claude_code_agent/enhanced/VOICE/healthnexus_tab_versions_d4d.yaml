title: "Bridge2AI-Voice: An ethically-sourced, diverse voice dataset linked to health information"
description: |-
  Bridge2AI-Voice v1.0 is a comprehensive collection of data derived from voice recordings with corresponding clinical information to enable research on voice as a biomarker of health. The initial release provides 12,523 recordings for 306 participants collected across five sites in North America. Participants were selected based on known conditions which manifest within the voice waveform including voice disorders, neurological disorders, mood disorders, and respiratory disorders. As of v1.0, only data from the adult cohort is available. This initial release contains data considered low risk, including derivations such as spectrograms and engineered features, but not the original voice recordings. Detailed demographic, clinical, and validated questionnaire data are also made available. Data collection used a standardized protocol with a custom tablet application, headset recording when possible, and REDCap; preprocessing included resampling to 16 kHz with a Butterworth anti-aliasing filter and derivation of spectrograms and acoustic/phonetic/prosodic features.
