title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
description: >-
  The AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes is a multimodal research
  dataset consisting of data collected from individuals with and without Type 2
  Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three data collection sites. The
  dataset was designed with future AI/Machine Learning studies in mind, including
  recruitment aimed at achieving approximately equal distribution across diabetes
  severity and a standardized acquisition protocol spanning multiple domains
  (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable
  device data, etc.). The project goal is to better understand salutogenesis
  (the pathway from disease to health) in T2DM. Public, non-sensitive data are
  available for download upon agreement with a license, while the full dataset
  is available under a data use agreement (DUA). Early releases (pilot phase)
  and periodic updates may not achieve balanced distributions across groups due
  to ongoing enrollment.

    title: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
    description: >-
      Versioned release of the AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes.
      Multimodal data across survey, clinical, physical measurements, imaging,
      wearable devices, ECG, blood sugar, and environmental variables were
      harmonized across three data collection sites to support downstream AI/ML
      analyses and research on salutogenesis in T2DM. Public, non-sensitive data
      are accessible under a license; full data are available via DUA. Enrollment
      is ongoing; pilot and periodic updates may not be balanced across groups.
    version: 2.0.0
