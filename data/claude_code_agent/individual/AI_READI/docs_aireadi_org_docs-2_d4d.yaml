name: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
title: AI-READI Dataset
description: >
  A harmonized, multi-modal dataset collected across three data collection sites
  from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The dataset
  was designed to enable future AI/Machine Learning studies, with recruitment and
  sampling aimed at approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity and
  a standardized data acquisition protocol spanning multiple domains (survey data,
  physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, etc.).
  The goal is to better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to
  health) in T2DM. A public dataset (non-sensitive) is downloadable under an
  agreement-defined license; the full dataset, which includes sensitive elements,
  is available via a data use agreement (DUA). Enrollment is ongoing; the pilot
  data release and subsequent updates may not achieve balanced distribution across
  all groups.

purposes:
  - response: Enable AI/ML research to better understand salutogenesis (pathway from disease to health) in T2DM using harmonized, multi-domain data.
tasks:
  - response: >
      Downstream AI/ML analyses across multiple domains (e.g., modeling from survey,
      clinical, lab, imaging, wearable, and environmental signals); not limited to
      tasks feasible with claims/EHR alone.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: >
      Provides an AI/ML-ready, harmonized, multi-domain cohort resource that enables
      analyses not feasible with existing sources such as claims or EHR data alone.

instances:
  - representation: >
      Human participants (individuals with and without T2DM) with multi-domain
      measurements.
    instance_type: >
      Single cohort with multiple data modalities per participant (e.g., surveys,
      clinical exams, labs, imaging, wearables, environmental measures).
    data_type: >
      Mixed data: tabular (surveys, labs, clinical measurements, environmental),
      time-series signals (e.g., ECG, activity), and images (e.g., retinal).
    label: >
      No single pre-defined target; resource intended for diverse AI/ML tasks.
