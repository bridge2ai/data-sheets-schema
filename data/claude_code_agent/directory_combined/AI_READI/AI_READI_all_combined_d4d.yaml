name: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: The AI-READI flagship dataset consists of multimodal data collected from individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across three collection sites. The study was designed for AI/ML readiness, with recruitment aimed at approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity and a standardized acquisition protocol spanning multiple domains (survey data, physical measurements, clinical data, imaging, wearable device data, etc.). Public data (non-sensitive) are available under a Health Data License; full data (including sensitive elements) are available under a data use agreement. The dataset supports research into salutogenesis (pathways from disease to health) in T2DM and is versioned with periodic updates as enrollment continues.

purposes:
  - response: Better understand salutogenesis (the pathway from disease to health) in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and enable downstream AI/ML analyses across multimodal health data.
tasks:
  - response: AI/ML method development and analysis for T2DM using multimodal clinical, imaging, wearable, and survey data.
addressing_gaps:
  - response: Provides an ethically sourced, harmonized, multimodal dataset for T2DM that is not feasible to obtain from claims/EHR alone; recruitment targeted balanced distribution across diabetes severity.

instances:
  - representation: Human participants with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).
    instance_type: Multiple modalities per participant, including survey responses, physical/clinical measurements, imaging (retinal), physiological signals (ECG), wearable device time series (e.g., CGM), lab results, and environmental variables.
    data_type: Mix of raw and processed data depending on domain; harmonized across three collection sites under a standardized acquisition protocol.
    sampling_strategies:
      - strategies:
          - Stratified recruitment to achieve approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity.
        is_representative:
          - Not fully representative in early releases due to ongoing enrollment.
        why_not_representative:
          - Pilot and periodic releases may not achieve balanced distribution across groups while enrollment is ongoing.
sampling_strategies:
  - strategies:
      - Stratified sampling by diabetes severity across three data collection sites under a harmonized protocol.
    is_representative:
      - Not fully representative in early releases due to ongoing enrollment.
    why_not_representative:
      - Interim releases may have imbalances across groups while recruitment continues.
anomalies:
  - description:
      - Early releases (pilot/periodic) may not fully achieve intended balanced distributions across severity groups.
external_resources:
  - external_resources:
      - Documentation portal for dataset details and domain-specific processing guidance (https://docs.aireadi.org/docs/2)
      - Some environmental exposure variables (e.g., traffic and accident reports) linked via participant geography may rely on external data sources.
    restrictions:
      - External data sources used for environmental variables may carry their own terms of use or licensing; consult source providers as applicable.
confidential_elements:
  - description:
      - Elements under controlled access include 5-digit ZIP code, sex, race, ethnicity, genetic sequencing data, past health records, and medications.
sensitive_elements:
  - description:
      - Health-related data including genetic data, medications, past health records.
      - Demographic attributes such as race and ethnicity.
      - Geolocation at 5-digit ZIP code granularity.
subpopulations:
  - identification:
      - Subpopulations are identifiable by diabetes severity, sex, race, and ethnicity (among others).
    distribution:
      - Recruitment targeted approximately equal distribution across diabetes severity; actual distributions in pilot/periodic releases may vary during ongoing enrollment.
is_deidentified:
  - description:
      - Publicly released subset excludes sensitive personal health data and is de-identified per project policies; controlled-access components include potentially re-identifiable elements and require a data use agreement.
acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - Data comprise directly observed clinical measurements and device outputs (e.g., ECG, retinal imaging, CGM), participant-reported survey responses, and variables derived/harmonized for analysis.
