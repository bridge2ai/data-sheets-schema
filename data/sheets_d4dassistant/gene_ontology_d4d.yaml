title: Gene Ontology (GO)
description: |
  The Gene Ontology (GO) project provides a computational model of biological systems,
  representing knowledge about the molecular functions of gene products, their cellular
  locations, and the biological processes they participate in. It comprises a structured
  ontology of terms describing gene and gene product functions, organized hierarchically,
  along with evidence-based annotations linking specific gene products to GO classes.
  The ontology spans over 100 species including humans, model organisms (mice, zebrafish,
  flies, yeast), plants, and bacteria.

purposes:
  - response: >
      The Gene Ontology aims to provide a uniform way to describe the functions of gene
      products from organisms across all kingdoms of life and enable genomic data analysis.
      Developed as a major bioinformatics initiative, GO emerged to standardize knowledge
      representation of gene functions in a format that is both human-readable and
      machine-interpretable for computational analysis. It creates a computational model
      of biological systems to enable understanding of how genes encode biological functions
      across molecular, cellular, and tissue levels.

collection_mechanisms:
  - mechanism: Literature curation
    description: Annotations derived from specific, traceable scientific evidence across peer-reviewed literature
  - mechanism: Computational prediction
    description: Computational predictions from multiple annotation contributor organizations

collection_timeframes:
  - description: >
      The Gene Ontology project is ongoing with regular releases. Daily snapshot versions
      are available, and the ontology is actively maintained and continuously updated.

preprocessing_strategies:
  - description: >
      The ontology is curated and structured hierarchically. Multiple format editions are
      generated from the core ontology, including OWL (primary format), OBO format, JSON
      (obographs format), basic filtered version for legacy tools, and extended versions
      (GO-Plus) with connections to external ontologies.

is_deidentified:
  identifiable_elements_present: false
  description:
    - The Gene Ontology contains no personal or identifiable information. It is a structured knowledge base of biological terms and concepts.

sensitive_elements:
  - sensitive_elements_present: false
    description:
      - The dataset contains only biological ontology terms and gene function annotations. No sensitive information is present.

existing_uses:
  - description: >
      The Gene Ontology is used for functional gene annotation by major biological databases
      including the GO Consortium, UniProt, and Alliance of Genome Resources. It is used
      for pathway and cellular localization annotation by Reactome, and for biochemical
      reaction description by the Rhea database. Enrichment analysis is powered by PANTHER.

distribution_formats:
  - description: >
      Multiple format editions are available: OWL (primary format), OBO format, JSON
      (obographs format), basic filtered version for legacy tools, and extended versions
      (GO-Plus) with connections to external ontologies including Cell Ontology, NCBI
      Taxonomy, Relation Ontology, Uberon, and NIF Standard ontologies.

acquisition_methods:
  - description:
      - >
        Ontology terms and annotations are curated from peer-reviewed scientific literature
        by expert biocurators. Computational predictions are also incorporated from multiple
        annotation contributor organizations. All annotations are traceable to specific
        scientific evidence.
