title: "Cell Maps for AI: Multimodal cellular structure and function datasets"
description: |
  The Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI) project is a coordinated NIH Bridge2AI effort to create comprehensive,
  multimodal maps of cellular structure and function across demographic and disease contexts. CM4AI integrates
  three complementary mapping approaches: proteomic mass spectrometry, cellular imaging, and genetic perturbation
  via CRISPR/Cas9. The project generates large-scale datasets designed to advance biomedical AI/ML applications
  and address the Bridge2AI Functional Genomics grand challenge.

  Comprehensive multimodal cellular dataset integrating:
  (1) Proteomic mass spectrometry for protein abundance and interactions
  (2) High-resolution cellular imaging for spatial organization and morphology
  (3) CRISPR/Cas9 genetic perturbation data for functional characterization

  The dataset provides integrated views of cellular structure and function across diverse cell types,
  disease contexts, and demographic groups to support AI/ML model development for biomedical research.

    response: |
      Addresses the critical need for large-scale, integrated multimodal cellular datasets to train
      AI/ML models for functional genomics. Existing datasets typically focus on single modalities
      or limited cell types. CM4AI provides comprehensive integration across proteomics, imaging,
      and genetic perturbation data at unprecedented scale.

            Sampling prioritizes cell types and disease contexts most relevant to functional genomics
            research questions. Not all human cell types or diseases are equally represented. Demographic
            diversity is intentionally incorporated but may not match population distributions.
