description: >
  Cell Maps for Artificial Intelligence (CM4AI) is the Functional Genomics Grand Challenge in the NIH Bridge2AI
  program. CM4AI aims to map the spatiotemporal architecture of human cells and utilize these maps for interpretable
  genotype-phenotype learning. The project generates comprehensive, AI-ready datasets combining three complementary
  mapping strategies: (1) CRISPR/Cas9 genetic perturbation screens with perturb-seq, (2) proteomic mass spectrometry
  (SEC-MS) for protein-protein interactions, and (3) cellular imaging for spatial subcellular organization mapping.

  The CM4AI dataset collection includes data from multiple cell types: undifferentiated KOLF2.1J human induced
  pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs), neurons, cardiomyocytes, and
  MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells. All data are packaged with provenance graphs and rich metadata as AI-ready
  datasets in RO-Crate format using the FAIRSCAPE framework. Data releases are available quarterly through the
  University of Virginia Dataverse repository.

  As of the March 2025 Beta release, the dataset includes: 53,788 immunofluorescence images, 1,792 proteins
  investigated, 11,739 genes targeted via CRISPR, 1,374 protein interactions mapped, totaling 22.7 TB of data.
  CM4AI is a multi-institutional collaboration led by UC San Diego with partners at UCSF, Stanford, University
  of Virginia, Yale, University of Texas at Austin, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Simon Fraser University,
  and the Hastings Center.
