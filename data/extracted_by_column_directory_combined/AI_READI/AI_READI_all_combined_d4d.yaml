name: AI-READI Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes
title: Flagship Dataset of Type 2 Diabetes from the AI-READI Project
description: >
  The AI-READI flagship dataset consists of multi-domain data collected from
  individuals with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), harmonized across
  three data collection sites. The study design targeted approximately equal
  distribution of participants across diabetes severity and includes survey data,
  physical measurements, clinical data, imaging data, wearable device data, and
  environmental measurements to enable downstream AI/ML analyses not feasible with
  claims or electronic health record data. A public dataset (non-sensitive data)
  is available under a Health Data License; access to the full dataset requires a
  data use agreement. Enrollment has been ongoing; early releases may not achieve
  balanced distributions across groups. This repository is noted as under review
  for potential modification in compliance with Administration directives.

          - Study design targeted balance by diabetes severity
        why_not_representative:
          - Enrollment ongoing; early releases may not be balanced across groups
        strategies:
          - Targeted recruitment to achieve approximately equal distribution by diabetes severity
