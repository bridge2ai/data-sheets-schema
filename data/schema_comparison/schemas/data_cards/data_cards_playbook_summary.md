# Data Cards Playbook: Schema and Template Overview

## Project Summary

The Data Cards Playbook is an archived repository (as of August 5, 2025) that provides documentation frameworks for ML datasets. It emphasizes "a people-centered approach to transparency in dataset documentation."

## Template Structure

The repository contains three primary transparency artifact templates:

1. **Data Cards Extended Template** (.docx format)
   - Comprehensive documentation framework with multiple sections and guided questions
   - Designed to document datasets across various domains and organizational contexts

2. **Healthsheet Template** (.docx format)
   - Specialized for healthcare-specific datasets
   - Based on associated research (arXiv:2202.13028)

3. **Model Card Template** (.docx format)
   - Focuses on general-purpose ML models
   - References foundational research (arXiv:1810.03993)

## Key Schema Components

Data Cards address essential dataset aspects including:
- Upstream data sources
- Collection and annotation methodologies
- Training and evaluation approaches
- Intended use cases
- Performance-affecting decisions
