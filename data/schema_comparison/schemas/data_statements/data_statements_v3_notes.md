# Data Statements for NLP - Schema Notes

## Overview
Data Statements for Natural Language Processing provides a framework for documenting language datasets to mitigate bias in NLP systems. Version 3 was published by the Tech Policy Lab at the University of Washington.

## Note on PDF Access
The PDF specification (https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Data_Statements-Guide-III.pdf) contains encoded binary data that couldn't be directly parsed. The following represents general knowledge about Data Statements schema structure.

## General Schema Components

Data Statements frameworks typically document:

### Dataset Composition and Origins
- Speaker/population demographics
- Language variety and linguistic characteristics
- Geographic and temporal coverage
- Data source provenance

### Data Collection Methodologies
- Collection setting and context
- Recording equipment and conditions
- Sampling methodology
- Collection timeframe

### Intended Use Cases and Limitations
- Primary intended uses
- Discouraged use cases
- Known limitations and biases
- Generalization constraints

### Annotator Information
- Annotator demographics
- Annotation instructions and protocols
- Inter-annotator agreement metrics
- Annotation platform details

### Legal and Ethical Considerations
- Licensing and permissions
- Privacy considerations
- Ethical review status
- Consent procedures
