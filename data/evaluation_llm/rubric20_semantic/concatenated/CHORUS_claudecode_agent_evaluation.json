      "DOI format issue in external_resources: 'http://doi:10.1007/s12028-024-02007' should use standard 'doi.org/' format",

      "No explicit dataset versioning scheme (e.g., v1.0, v2.0) despite ongoing expansion",
      "RRID identifiers not present for software tools and resources",
      "Some external resource entries use placeholder descriptions without actual URLs (e.g., 'AIM-AHEAD Consortium website', 'OHDSI website')",
      "Specific demographic breakdowns (age, race/ethnicity, gender distributions) not provided despite strong equity emphasis",
      "No structured change log or formal release notes with timestamps",
      "Single peer-reviewed publication referenced (though appropriate for dataset still under development)",

      "Add software version numbers for OHDSI tools, OHNLP toolkit version, WFDB library version used in processing",
      "Implement formal versioning scheme (e.g., v1.0 for initial release, v2.0 for major expansions) with release notes",
      "Add RRID identifiers for OMOP CDM (RRID:SCR_009967), OHDSI tools, and OHNLP toolkit where available",
      "Replace placeholder external resource descriptions with actual URLs (e.g., https://aim-ahead.org/, https://ohdsi.org/)",
      "Add demographic summary statistics (age ranges, race/ethnicity distributions, gender proportions) to support equity claims",
      "Create structured change log documenting dataset releases, expansions, and quality improvements with timestamps",
      "Document additional publications as they become available (dataset methodology paper, application papers)",
      "Consider adding structured grant award fields (award_number, award_amount, award_dates) separate from funder description",
      "Add formal dataset citation field with recommended citation format for users",
      "Document specific software tool GitHub repositories in external_resources (e.g., https://github.com/chorus-ai/chorus_waveform)",
      "Add errata field for documenting known issues and corrections across dataset versions"
