    "grade_interpretation": "C+ (74%) - Good datasheet with exceptional technical and scientific documentation but significant gaps in interoperability, limitations disclosure, and cross-platform integration",
    "key_findings": "The AI-READI datasheet excels in scientific motivation (100%) and technical transparency (100%), demonstrating comprehensive documentation of purposes, funding, creators, collection mechanisms, and acquisition methods. However, it falls short in cross-platform integration (40%), limitations disclosure (60%), and interoperability (60%) due to missing critical metadata fields (DOI, citation, variables, standards conformance, version, limitations, biases). Information is often buried in textual descriptions rather than structured top-level fields, reducing machine-readability. The datasheet prioritizes narrative completeness over structured metadata schema compliance.",

    "comparison_context": "This evaluation provides absolute scoring against rubric10 criteria. Comparison to other generation methods (GPT-5, curated) would require evaluating those files with the same rubric."
